<p>What an interesting view into one of history's most significant people. I was somewhat equally captivated by the history and traditions of the time, as I was with the person himself. Having read as many biographies as I have, I wish there were more specifics about situations, and his character on display. I'm not sure that can be solved, thanks to the 2000+ years of separation (and the delay in many of the authoritative writings on him, which didn't start until _so_ long after his death). Regardless, the author does a good job in trying to paint as complete of a picture as possible of Caesar. I'll have to find something else to educate me more on the time period, now that I'm not in high school, bored out of my mind.</p>
