	<p>I was told about an upcoming change before it was public knowledge. I was informed about the change by an individual with the proper authority. We talked about the change that was to take place, how it might impact me and others, and how the message needed to be communicated in a variety of ways for various people. We talked a little about damage control and the sensitivity of the information. It became apparent that there could be some adverse reactions if the details of the change got out without proper communication. What struck me in this whole thing was the following – although the conversation was originally masked as a “I need to get your input on this” session, it really was a “We need to tell you this now, since you're one of those who would normally complain the most” conversation.</p>
<p>Reflecting back to my recent discussion of <a href="/blog/responding-to-the-unfamiliar">Responding to the Unfamiliar</a> I guess I might be one of those that needs to examine things a bit more closely. During the conversation I realized that I was being damage controlled, and not consulted. I was careful to pay attention to how I was reacting (not necessarily to change it, but to observe it). I think it was important in some whacked way to see that I went roughly through the following emotions</p>
<ul>
<li>Speculation</li>
<li>Disapproval</li>
<li>Doubt</li>
<li>Seeking Clarification</li>
<li>Trying to work things through</li>
<li>Tentative Approval</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know if these are the best words to describe it, but it works. Should I take each of these things as internal as it may appear on this site? Who knows. Am I really one that needs to be consulted for damage control? Maybe so. Whatever.</p>
