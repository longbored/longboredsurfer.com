<p>For the most part I've swapped the site over to showing the right design. There are a couple little places that it doesn't quite work right. One place would be in the search results... still need to figure out how to get that modified. I've made some additions to the graphics to go a bit more with the theme. Almost there!</p>
<p>Really though, a post like this isn't for anybody but me. I'm just making sure that my templates are working correctly in the background. Sometimes you can't tell if things REALLY work properly until you try to make an update. That was the case earlier, when I added a second post, then all of a sudden my main page was messed up. Little did I realize that I had misplaced one of my tags.</p>
