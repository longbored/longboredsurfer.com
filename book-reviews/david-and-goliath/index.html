<p>What an interesting set of stories, conveying the simple message that perceived underdogs don't have to end up losing. Regardless, I wish the book were tied up a bit better. If it were a novel, it would have been, and if it were a non-fiction book, it would have been as well. As it was, it felt like the book just... ended.</p>
