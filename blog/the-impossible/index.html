<p class="meta">Published on 2006-08-16 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p><img alt="The Impossible" src="impossible_400.jpg" />I have achieved the near impossible. It was difficult and required immense concentration. I knew that if I focused hard enough, and kept the prize in mind, that I would be able to accomplish that which I had originally set out to do. The goal (from my understanding) had never been set so high. Owls are claimed to be very wise, but if the <a href="http://www.tootsie.com/howmany-sb.html">official owl</a> failed at this as well, then maybe their wisdom is just knowledge as they failed to apply that knowledge correctly. I made it all the way through a <a href="http://www.tootsie.com/pops.html">Tootsie Pop</a> without biting it. Yeah, I know... I'm cool.</p>
<p>I'm aware that the official challenge is to find out how many licks it takes. I viewed the real challenge as not biting it. <a href="http://www.tootsie.com/memoriesLicksMachine.html">Other people</a> have already spent too much time trying to figure that out. (random note here - that whole "send in your wrappers which have indians and stars and get a free bag of tootsie pops" thing? <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa030701a.htm">total sham</a>)</p>
