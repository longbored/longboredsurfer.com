<p>What a remarkable man. Combine him with his wife, and I think they were one of the most remarkable couples in our nation's history. The amount of material that John Adams wrote himself (both in a journal, and letters) seems to be a treasure trove of information and insight into the forming of our nation, and one of its most notable men. I started reading this book forever ago, but stopped for no particular reason. In an effort to finish all of my unfinished books, I restarted it a few weeks ago, and am glad I did. The narrative is smoothly done and encompassing. Once again, David McCullough has made me care about something/someone that otherwise I probably wouldn't have, at least to the depth that I now do.</p>
