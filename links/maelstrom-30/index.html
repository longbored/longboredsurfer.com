<p>What a fabulous (albeit random) find! Pay no attention to the horrendous website design, or the obviously old-school game... just trust me that it's a real winner; a super-simple Asteriod-esque game. Download it, play it, love it. Don't tell my father about it, however, since I want to be the one to make him wet his pants in excitement. He misses this game, and honestly so did I. I sure wish <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com">Ambrosia</a> would bring back some of their other games.</p>
