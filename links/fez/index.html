<p>I know FEZ II just got announced today, but I'm still stuck on the original, because I've never played it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...You play as Gomez, a 2D creature living in what he believes is a 2D world. Until a strange and powerful artifact reveals to him the existence of a mysterious third dimension."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've had a tab in my browser open to the trailer for this for weeks, and I re-watch it every day, trying to wrap my mind around this. Thankfully, they also released this game for PC and not just XBox, and it's just $10. Now to find a PC I can play this on (and to convince my wife I can buy it...)</p>
