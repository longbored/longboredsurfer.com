<h2>Second Review</h2>
<p>While elements of the book felt unnecessarily rushed, or potentially too big of a leap for how I understood the characters, this was a really enjoyable story. I've enjoyed this series of books. And maybe you'd like them too, if you've dabbled in fantasy novels before.</p>
<p>The original trilogy takes place during a medieval-like time period. This book is the third in a set of four, taking place during an industrial revolution-like time period - yet with the same magic system, that continues to evolve. While the book would be <em>much</em> more enjoyable reading the books before it, it'd be passable to read it while skipping the others.</p>
<p>One of my favorite characters from this set of four books is Wayne - a quirky, kleptomaniac constable, with a knack for impersonations, sarcasm, and self-deprecating humor and humility. The audiobook reader, Michael Kramer, does a particularly good job with Wayne's various accents and voices.</p>
<p>This was a reread for me. I originally read it when it was first released (2016), and wanted to reread the entire series in preparation for the latest books in the series (which takes place right after this one), which happened late last year.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, the book is written well enough I didn't/don't feel the need to reread the two other books of this era in order to start the fourth book. Brandon Sanderson does a good job of reminding people what is going on, and bring in enough of the (seemingly irrelevant) past to enrich events as they happen.</p></div>
