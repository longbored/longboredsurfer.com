<div class="content"><p>I really liked the "stick completely to actual records" approach of this book. I know Erik Larson does that with some <em>version</em> of that in his other books, but this one felt even more by-the-book. WWII was nasty, and what England had to deal with, due to its proximity to the European theater, was as well. Despite how many books on WWII I've read, I found this really insightful and engaging. Churchill himself still seems bizarre in a variety of ways, and also fascinating and worthy of more in-depth reading (like [b:Churchill: Walking with Destiny|38470102|Churchill Walking with Destiny|Andrew Roberts|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1532427913l/38470102._SY75_.jpg|60098961] by Andrew Roberts, which I really enjoyed). Despite the very by-the-book approach of this book, it didn't drag, and felt very fluid. Well done.</p></div>
