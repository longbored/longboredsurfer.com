	<p>I think I was 10 years old before I realized that the “game” called “52 Card Pick-up” wasn't trying to make any reference to small trucks. It was obvious that the game itself had nothing to do with them. Somebody would spray a deck of cards all over the floor, and the point of the game... was to pick them up. Any time the game came up I had these thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a retarded game. Why am I playing it?</li>
<li>Why on <em>earth</em> do they call it a “pickup” when there is clearly no pickup involved?</li>
<li>Why am I playing this” again?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, turbo... it's because you're a sucker enough to pick up somebody else's mess, not because you get to drive around a little wannabe truck. Thanks for playing &amp; come again!</p>
