<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a relatively quick read, and I found myself laughing out loud more than I would have thought. For those that enjoy a cleverly turned phrase, or humor in precisely written or spoken word, Stamper does a great job. At times the books is a bit vulgar, yet she also explains some of that irreverence - and it shouldn't be a deterrent in thise case.</p>
