<h1><a href="//20190415-don-quixote/">Don Quixote</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</b></p>
<p>"It's one of the greatest books of fiction ever written." It's also rather boring for the 21st century. Alonso Quixano reads so many fictional books about chivalrous knights that he decides to take on the name of Don Quixote, knight errant. He ventures off in honor of his peerless maiden (see: completely made up, then 100-percent-mistakenly-deluded-about farm girl) Dulcinea del Toboso. He goes into the wild to pursue this fantasy, and is basically a fearless buffoon, who everybody thinks is crazy (including Sancho Panza). He realizes his buffoonery on his death bed. Sure, there are amusing tidbits, but it's just not worth it. There - I saved you 800-1000+ pages of reading.</p>
