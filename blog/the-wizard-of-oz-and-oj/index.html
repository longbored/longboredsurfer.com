<p>I recently watched The Wizard of Oz. It's a much better movie than I remember it being. I could talk about several different parts of it which were impressive to me. With all of this in mind though, there was one important detail which would have been useful to all of us back during the OJ Simpson trial - just because you kill two people, somehow you'll still be allowed back into society.</p>
