<p>Conditions are perfect. A couple days ago I tell Maria I'm going to start making the bed in the mornings. I'm usually up before her, but I have time in the morning to perform a simple one minute task, plus I don't have children depending on me for anything. I figured that by starting to make the bed <em>before</em> April 1st, I'd throw her off the scent. The entire day takes place without <em>any</em> mention of it being April Fools'. If she <em>does</em> bring it up later in the evening, she won't think I've thought of it ahead of time, so there's nothing to worry about. Not even a hint of anything out of the ordinary. Not a whiff of it.</p>
<p>A whiff of what? Why... short-sheeting the bed, of course. I'm at like 3 or 4 years in a row of doing this, and she continually forgets. Blogging about it is almost a sure way to make sure I can't do it again for a number of years, but that's okay. My mother used to be the one to get me every year. Wax paper in my lunch sandwich, the plastic left on the cheese in my tuna fish, getting short-sheeted, lies that made me cry... the usual. Nothing too far out there, but enough to remind me that somebody was paying attention to me. So, although I laugh at Maria's misfortune, it's just a little way to remind her that I love her. Hope she likes the benefit of somebody else making the bed. Wonder when I'll be able to get out of that one.</p>
