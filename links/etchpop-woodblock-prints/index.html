<p>Want to make your own custom woodblock prints? Now you can, with ease. Sure, you still need to go through the effort of rolling out each one, but that's the point - they're individually made... by hand. Don't get me wrong, the insane beauty of <a href="http://www.ukiyoeheroes.com/">multi-layered Japanese woodblock prints</a> is unparalleled, but still, this is pretty cool. I'd go for something fairly small, so I could use it as stationary, but then again, nobody is offering to buy one for me.</p>
