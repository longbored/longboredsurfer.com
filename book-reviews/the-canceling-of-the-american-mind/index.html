	<div class="content"><p>This was an interesting book from, in part, one of the authors of another book I really liked ("The Coddling of the American Mind"). The other author of that book wrote "The Anxious Generation" - and this book follows the collective theme. Some opposition isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, it can be a very good thing.</p>
<p>If I were to try to summarize the book: you're not a bad person for disagreeing with me. Similarly, I'm not a bad person because I don't agree with you. Not everybody has to agree about everything, and we damage ourselves as a society by silencing those who don't line up with our thinking. I have the right and freedom to share my point of view. And you should have that right as well, even if I don't agree with you. And just because we don't agree doesn't mean we should be unkind to each other. When we choose to silence those who we disagree with, or who have done/said things in their past that we don't agree with, we are also claiming we don't deserve a voice. Personal attacks have no place when trying to discuss issues, especially since good people can say bad things and bad people can say good things. We're all more nuanced than some of the all-or-nothing thinking dictates.</p>
<p>No, I'm not a member of your political party. Or theirs. Both sides employ the tactic with great success. We could all benefit from more civilized and respectful discourse, not to mention some critical thinking.  Lastly, here's a quote I liked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are lucky enough to live in a country where people can confuse the democratic right to free speech as guaranteed under the First Amendment and the older, philosophical principle of freedom of speech. Indeed, a private venue has its own free speech and associational rights to not have a comedian perform there. But simply because the First Amendment—rightly!—doesn’t require clubs to host comedians doesn’t mean that canceling a show in the face of social pressure is an equally good outcome for free expression.</p>
