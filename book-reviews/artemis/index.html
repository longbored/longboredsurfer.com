<h1><a href="//20190208-artemis/">Artemis</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Andy Weir</b></p>
<p>An entertaining, if unnecessarily vulgar, story of a moon colony, and a brilliant, young smuggler trying to make ends meet.  </p>
<p>I enjoyed the Martian more, for a variety of reasons. Despite that, what Andy Weir seems to have going for him is an ability to make scientific worlds, occurrences, practices, and theories seem completely understandable and relatable. If you have an aversion to science fiction books because the science always feels beyond understanding, don't let that stand in the way for this book.</p>
