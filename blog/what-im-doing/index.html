<p>In case anybody is curious about what I'm doing on here... I've been trying to modify some of the templates that are used here, and make this a bit better looking (and more compatible with other browsers) site. The original look wasn't really very compatible with things, so I'm moving on to this new look, which I borrowed from blogger. I'll modify it shortly after this to go more with the theme that I've established.</p>
<p>Fear not the ugly pages... they'll be fixed in due time.</p>
