<p>Better than 2, not as good as 1, but the author spun a very good tale in this book.  </p>
<p>Seriously. I have no clue why so many females enjoy these books. Sure, there's a female protagonist. Sure, there's some love. If I were to tell you that I just read a series about a post-apocalyptic America where they've resorted to gladiator-type games with teenagers, you'd laugh and swear on all that's holy that you wouldn't read it. Despite that, you've read these books. Go figure.</p>
