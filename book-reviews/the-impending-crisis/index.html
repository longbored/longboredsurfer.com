<p>I would not recommend this book for people passively interested in antebellum America. It's heavy. That said, it's an interesting dive into pre-Civil War America. I've read enough books about this Civil War at this point (both from the perspective of Northern and Southern historians) that to me there's no mistaking why that war was started - the disgraceful "peculiar institution", slavery. It's interesting to see this nation full of people who "speak the same language, but don't understand each other" focus inward on their selfishness, and turn towards their perceived area and political party "needs" instead of advancing the nation in the right direction. Similarities to modern times about in that regard. *sigh*</p>
