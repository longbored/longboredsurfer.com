<p class="meta">Published on 2007-01-08 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>A hero. A legend. A modern-day and non-fictional Robin Hood. A destroyer of hunger. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momofuku_Ando">Ando Momofuku</a>, the inventor of the world's first instant noodle, has died. He was 96. He shall be known for his hand in Cup Noodle (not "Cup o' Noodles" like some people like to say), Top Ramen and for helping the countless number of impoverished people that have looked to his food for a helping hand. In honor of his passing (unlike <a href="/blog/so-long-tori">my memorial for Aaron Spelling</a>) I offer this haiku:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tasty Top Ramen<br />
Makes me full for ten minutes<br />
Then I need more food</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And because I'm a little emotional about this all still, I offer this additional haiku:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some little green peas,<br />
Somehow in this Cup Noodle<br />
I think they're gross</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you find time during your day, please be sure to observe a moment of silence in honor of him. My condolences go out to his family and others that he left behind.</p>
