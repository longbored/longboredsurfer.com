<div class="content"><p>I really liked this book. Brandon Sanderson continues to be one of my favorite authors as he interweaves various storylines, and welcomes you into a world that is both complete fantasy, and totally relatable all at the same time.</p>
<p>Like so many other series, if you haven't read the prior books, I don't think it's for you. The pacing was much better than the third book, and the storylines were much more engaging. I loved the various developments of the story, and feel somehow much more engaged in the series than I was before. Lastly, I appreciate the openness and delicateness he approaches mental health in this book. It's far more common than some would have you believe, and it's nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<h2>Second Review</h2>
<p>On my second time through this book, agree with my initial review. Admittedly, this was the single book I decided to revisit prior to starting the next book. This book started with a few unfamiliar elements, but I appreciated how the author would do some gentle reminders. I'm thoroughly excited for the next book in this series.</p></div>
