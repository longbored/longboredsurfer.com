This is the generated static HTML for my site. You can read all about the details about my move away from a dynamically generated PHP-based site to this newer site that's created by my own static site generator [here](https://longboredsurfer.com/blog/blogging-again).

I'm not cool enough (yet?) to have my originating content markdown and yaml files, nor the Python for my static site generator shared here.

Due to how this site is generated currently, PRs to this repo won't be accepted. If you have a fix for the content, I guess you could open a PR, or just contact me via the site.
