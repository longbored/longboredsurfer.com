<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Connie Willis</b></p>
<p>An enjoyable book, where time travel is somewhat commonplace, and scientific. The Space-Time Contiuum is respected, and nobody is throwing things completely out of whack. Visits to other times/places are for educational or research purposes, and things go smoothly. Until they don't.  </p>
<p>While I enjoyed this book, I also felt like it could have been 25% shorter. But maybe all of the added details will play out to the benefit of the series as a whole.</p>
