<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>William Craig</b></p>
<p>Although the battle/siege was really crucial to WWII and the demise of the Nazis, this book won't be crucial to your understanding of that. The atrocities of WWII are numerous, and the extents people will go to for self-preservation (or to avoid starvation) are lengthy. Mix those two together, and you've got some idea of what is covered in this book. Plus, there are way too many troop movements in unfamiliar territory. My negative impressions aside, I appreciate all of the first-hand accounts retrieved through interviews, letters, journals, etc. The first half of the book was rather slow, but picked up significantly in the second half. I'd really only recommend this book if you're <em>really</em> into WWII.</p>
