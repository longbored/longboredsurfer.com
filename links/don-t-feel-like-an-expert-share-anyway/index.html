<p>Not that this simple blog qualifies in anyway for what Sara is talking about, but her message has stirred <em>something</em> in me. You know that course I developed that will teach you a computer language, and I made a bunch of videos for? You know that unique perspective I have on X, Y, or Z as I have plugged through it? I didn't think so - probably good to share some of that, in some way. Maybe you should, too. Hm.</p>
