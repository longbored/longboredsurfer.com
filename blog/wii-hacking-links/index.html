	<h1><a href="/blog/wii-hacking-links">Wii Hacking Links</a></h1>
	<p class="meta">Published on 2016-03-06</p>
	<p>Years ago I hacked my Wii, and I was/am thrilled with it. I have no interest in pirating games, but I'm <em>very</em> interested in my kids not scratching the game discs, and leaving them out to be ruined. Hacking my Wii allowed me to hook up a hard drive to the Wii, and show them how to play any/every game we own without ruining another (expensive) disc. I'm not going to bother trying to do a comprehensive write-up of how I went about doing it, but I'm doing a clean-up of all of my (still) open tabs, and all of these go together. In case you're a person who cares about this sort of thing, you get the benefit of having some helpful links together. If you're not a person who cares, you'll likely ignore this, as you have with so much other stuff on my site.</p>
<p>I share these links in the general order that I needed them. Since it's been so long since I originally hacked my Wii, I don't really remember what I needed/used on each page/site. Regardless, here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/completesg/before-you-begin">Before you begin - Complete Softmod Guide</a> - This a good general walk-through, and will give you some clue if you're really up to it. Although it has some details, I wanted a bit more authority.</li>
<li><a href="http://gwht.wikidot.com">GAF's Wii Homebrew Tutorial</a> - Lots of great walk-throughs on various pieces. Pay particular attention to his walkthrough on <a href="http://gwht.wikidot.com/ios236">IOS236</a>. Fortunately, he has a lot more explained (in detail) than the prior link.</li>
<li><a href="http://gbatemp.net/threads/configurable-usb-loader.147638/">Configurable USB Loader</a> - The most essential piece of this all, since this is what you run to run all of your Wii/GC games.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.det1re.de/d/index.php">det1re.de/d/</a> - Seems to be a place to get a variety of the software/roms/wads/etc they ask for in the installers</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hacksden.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=93">Multi-Mod Manager 13.4</a> - No clue</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WiiHacks/comments/25i5vm/the_ultimate_dios_mios_tutorial_newbies_check/">The Ultimate DIOS MIOS Tutorial</a> - A good walk-through to install DIOS MIOS, which lets you soft-launch your GameCube games/ROMs from Configurable USB Loader.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/diosmios/">DIOS MIOS</a> - The actual DIOS MIOS</li>
</ul>
