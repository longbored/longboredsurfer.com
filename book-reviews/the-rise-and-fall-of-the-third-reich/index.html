<div class="content"><p>Ho. ly. Cow. It felt like this book took forever to finish (when in reality it took me a couple months). As we follow the escapades of a severely misguided man, and his foolish accomplices, Shirer paints a clear picture of their choices, influences, successes, and their ultimate (wonderful) failure. What an awful group of people, making horrendous decisions based on greed, misinformation, and blind prejudice. Shirer's numerous first-hand accounts of people and events are astounding, and add a new element to a historical book that I previously hadn't experienced. This book was extremely insightful, but probably would have been better had I not been (at times) confused by the numerous players involved.</p>
<p>P.S. Hitler sucks.</p></div>
