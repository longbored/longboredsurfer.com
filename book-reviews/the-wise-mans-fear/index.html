<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Patrick Rothfuss</b></p>
<p>I wish I could rate this 5.5 stars, only so it would be rated higher than the first book of the series. Both books have been very enjoyable. I liked the wide array of locations in this book, but would actually cut out a bunch of time with the Fae, if I could.  </p>

<p>(Added with my 3/31/2018 reread:)<br />
The excessive discovery of a libido in this book continues to be off-putting to me, and irrelevant to the overall story (or at least, I hope so). It remains the single qualm I have with suggesting this book to younger readers. Despite that, this time through I enjoyed paying attention to the foreshadowing - there's enough of it in the first book that clearly points out later events, that I have to believe _numerous_ clues are firmly ensconced in this second book. Each time I read this book, I'm also glad that Rothfuss was able to continue the narrative so well through some very different circumstances than the first book had.</p>
