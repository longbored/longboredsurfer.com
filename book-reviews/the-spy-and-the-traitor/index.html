<p>One of the first types of book that really pulled me into reading were all the books by Tom Clancy. I devoured book upon book of espionage stories and secret government agency actions. So, while I read this non-fiction book, I couldn't help but try to think how much of what those other books had in them that was inspired by real-life actions - and vice-versa. The conversation in the book club for this one was around some of the actions, and the ability of Oleg to do what needed to be done at various points. Still - hard to believe it's a true story.</p>
