<p>To me, if you walk with a cane, and don't put very much weight on it, yet you walk at a very quick pace... why walk with a cane at all? Do you just keep it with you so you can beat unsuspecting observers? I could see very clearly in the example I'm speaking of that it wasn't a walking stick, but a cane - and the lady was moving fast. She sort of had one of those hunched-over walks that says, "Best watch yourself, since I'm coming through, and if you get in my way... I'll thwack ya' good!" Go figure. (on a side note, I'm pleased to say that my spell checker acknowledges 'thwack' as an actual word)</p>
