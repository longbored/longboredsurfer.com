<p>I really disliked the narrator in the audio book of this (Stephen Hoye). The whole book felt like a pharmaceutical commercial... and this book lasted more than four hours. With the wonky narration, it probably has downgraded my opinion of the rest of the book, which was interesting, yet unsurprising, given my recent dive into "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich". I could appreciate the perspective on the ambassador, his family, and his approach to diplomacy. Despite his accurate view into how things would play out, I'm not sure his approach was the correct one. I suppose if you're looking for a light view of the German scene, from an American perspective before the start of WWII, this would certainly handle that.</p>
