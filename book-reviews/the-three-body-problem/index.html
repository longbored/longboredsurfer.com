<p>This was enjoyable. It's interesting to me how often some science fiction books come back to some moral issue at the core of the book. "Let's invent all <em>sorts</em> of other things, so we can simply make the reader ponder an issue." That said, I enjoyed what they created in the book. I'm curious to read the follow-up books.  </p>
<p>It feels a little tricky to describe the book well without spoiling it. The characters themselves are originally in the dark, so why should the potential reader know more the characters? A mix of science, intrigue, video games, and moral issues, all mixed into a book you're likely to enjoy if you like science fiction books.</p>
