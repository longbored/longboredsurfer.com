<p>I really liked this book (though it took me a while to finish, for some reason). The story follows Daniel, a young man in Barcelona in 1945, who acquires a book by one Julián Carax. After falling in love with the book, he obsessively learns about the author, and tries to figure out why he appears to have not only the last known copy of that book, but any books by Carax. With plenty of intrigue, twists, turns, and solid story-telling, I'm glad I already own the next book in the series.</p>
