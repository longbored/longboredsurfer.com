<p>A little over 2 years ago I talked about <a href="/blog/soundtrack-of-your-life">The Soundtrack of Your Life</a>. It was an activity with which I was thoroughly pleased originally and have been reminded of its coolness. I've been listening to a lot of my previous mixes I've made lately, and among them was my own personal soundtrack. The super strict side of me would say that you shouldn't know the song list unless you yourself have done the actual challenge, but I still feel like posting it. Also, at the end of the post, I tell you how I'll buy you an album from the iTunes Store... tantalizing... I know.</p>
<p>Although I have posted the song list here below, I am under no obligation to explain the song selection, the name of the album/mix or anything of the sort. If you'd like the details about it, I would be glad to get a copy of your soundtrack then exchange stories. :)</p>

<p>Since my soundtrack was originally compiled in March or April of 2002, I would be curious to see what my soundtrack would look like now if I were to redo it. Maybe I'll give it another year.</p>
<p>Just for fun I'll tell you a couple stories about some of the songs:</p>
<ul>
<li>You Can Call Me Al - I don't know how long it took for me as a kid to figure out that Chevy Chase wasn't Paul Simon. For those of you unaware, in the music video for this song Chevy Chase would lip sync and "play" musical instruments that Paul Simon retrieved. Funny stuff.</li>
<li>Going Out of My Head - This song is from an album called "Better Living Through Chemistry". I was at the grocery store the other day wearing a shirt with that title on it, and the bagger said that her chemistry teacher would "freak out" if he could get that shirt. I <strong>highly</strong> doubt she had any clue as to what the shirt was referencing—neither the album, nor any other cultural references. Just having the word “chemistry” on it was good enough for her. I felt really old both, not only for the amount of time it has been since I took high school chemistry, but also to be wearing a shirt so <strong>not</strong> current. Oh well. As another note about this song/album, this song was another one I first witnessed on MTV and knew immediately that I liked it.</li>
<li>Overall, I have seen three of these artists in concert at one point or another. One of them I won tickets to see, the other was part of a festival, and the other I specifically went to see. If you can guess which is which and you're not related to me, I'll uh... I'll buy you an album from one of those three artists from the iTunes Store*.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Yes, I'm totally serious. Only 1 submission per person, contest ends May 3, 2007. If nobody has it right by the deadline, I'll buy it for the person who can guess the three artists correctly, and if nobody can even guess that... then I get to buy myself a new album instead. Hey... I kinda like the sound of that, but good luck anyway. To “guess” just submit your response in the comments here.</p>
<p>Don't ask me why I'm doing this, because I don't know. I just feel like giving something away in a lame contest like this.</p>
