<p>He has some great stories to share - a couple of which had me laughing out loud. The book itself, however, doesn't really feel like it serves much purpose to the reader. It feels like a book to help the author get unstuck and reflect on his own life. Although he didn't come from a life of overt privilege, he clearly got some good chances, and took advantage of them - good for him. I'm not really a fan of the good ol' boy mentality of various aspects of things - the only shame is not in doing something bad/wrong, but in getting caught? Hm. I'm not sure if the book made me more or less of a fan of the author. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library.</p>
