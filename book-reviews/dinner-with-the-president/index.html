<p class="stars">⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>I'd like to give this 3.5 stars. This was a chronological (though not comprehensive) walk through the Presidents of the United States, and the culinary choices they made or had. There's a lot I liked about this book - but that probably has more to do with my feelings about American history as well as food. It was amusing to learn about the various things that some had flown in, or strictly avoided, or had an irrational intolerance of. I appreciated the extra insights into those around them as well. The pacing of the book was off, at times, and sometimes the author's interjected opinions felt out of place, or like they were detracting from the book. Still - very well researched, and insightful - if insightful into a footnote of history.</p>
