<p>Although I felt the main character had an unrealistic emotional attachment to her counterpart, and that the writing focused excessively on inconsequential details... I recognize I'm not the primary target audience for these books. The premise was enjoyable, and I finished the book quickly. I imagine I'll probably complete the series if each installment is of a similar caliber. Overall, it was better than I had guessed it would be.</p>
