<p>What if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokey_Pokey">the hokey pokey</a> is really what it's all about? There are lots of people that believe this. How many times have you been in a mass of people where this is being claimed? You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around - that's what it's all about.</p>
<p>Various parts of the body get put "in", shaken all about then get taken "out". What's up with this "whole self" thing? My understanding of the verb "to put" is that it is an action taken by one thing upon another. Explain to me how my "whole self" isn't part of me.</p>
<p>I guess my answer to my original question is this... if the hokey pokey is really what it's all about... I'd rather not participate.</p>
