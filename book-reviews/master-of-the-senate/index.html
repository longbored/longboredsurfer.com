<h1><a href="//20240402-master-of-the-senate/">Master of the Senate</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Robert A. Caro</b></p>
<p>This volume covers the majority of Johnson's twelve years in the Senate. I'm glad this volume exists. Finally one of my main reservations about Lyndon Johnson was articulated in a simple way: he was cruel. And while he continues to have many reprehensible qualities (including well-documented racist behaviors), him championing the first passage of a civil rights bill (no matter how meager) in the Senate, feels really significant. Anything to finally break the 80+ year streak of nothing... and finally <em>something</em>.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, I love the additional insight this volume gives to the workings of the Senate, and a view of America's history during this time. Caro continues to do such a great job of establishing the appropriate context to better understand it all. Caro's writing: five out of five. Johnson himself, at this point: some characteristics deserve a zero out of five, and others a five out of five.</p>
