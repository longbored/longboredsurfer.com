<p>Obviously I'm late to this, since Mark Weaver seems to have been Making Something Cool Every Day for all of 2009... and here it is 298 days into the year. How inspiring! For those of us who might want to try this, it might be good to try it for a week, or a month before committing to it for a whole year. Maybe an alternate to <a href="https://theinbetweenismine.com/nablopomo/">NaBloPoMo</a> or the upcoming <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>. Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.mrkwvr.com">his site and portfolio</a>. Very cool.</p>
