<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Malcolm Gladwell</b></p>
<p>Interesting, but somewhat inconclusive apart from "people are complicated." The book talked about "default to truth", "transparency", and "coupling" - three things I'm glad I know more about. It gave numerous examples of each to help illustrate them, and potentially how to either be aware of them, and maybe work with them. I've been duped. I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I'm a victim of my own impulses. I still wish the book were more conclusive.</p>
