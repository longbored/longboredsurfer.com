<p>Don't read this book without reading the other books before it in the series. For how this book fits into the series, its name says exactly what's going on - war. These groups are still trying to figure out their own abilities - things are changing frequently. Combine that with war itself - which feels like a time of innovation (of destruction and death (part of what makes war so horrible)), and it's not like the characters and people know what's about to happen. The story was engaging, and even tugged at my heartstrings at the right times. An enjoyable installment in the series.</p>
