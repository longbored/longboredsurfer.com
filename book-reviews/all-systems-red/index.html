<p>This book was too short. The series name is off-putting, since I don't really want to read about a bot that is designed to murder. Fortunately, Murderbot is a security unit with a conscience and a fuzzy past. And this was really enjoyable science fiction. A rich environment, well-described and built, especially in such a short book. I happily immediately started the next book.</p>
