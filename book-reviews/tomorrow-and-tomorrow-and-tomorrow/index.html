<p>I really enjoyed this one. It won't be for everyone, but it was right up my alley. A story of friends, love, relationships, loss, grief, and change - but centered around the lives of some intelligent video game creators. Gabrielle Zevin, the author, brings nearly a poetic element to the her story-telling, which really pulled me in. Furthermore, I really liked how she highlighted the creative and personal aspects of making video games. Zevin built great characters, nuanced and relatable in their own ways. A real win.</p>
