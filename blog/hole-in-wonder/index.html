<p>Usually the question is asked when we when we step onto the tee box of a Par 3... "Have you seen one?" My father asks it almost every time. If not him, then maybe my brother does. The answer has always been no. Today on the 15th hole at Navy Golf Course in Seal Beach that answer was changed. Apparently no more than 1 minute after telling himself that maybe he was done for the day, and maybe even for longer (since he was playing so bad), my father took his 6 iron and at a smooth 165 yards did the most efficient thing possible in golf, and just put it in the hole. Congratulations. I wish I could have been there.</p>
