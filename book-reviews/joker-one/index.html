<p>Interesting events. Not a very good book. Unfortunately, surviving life-altering circumstances while in the service of your country, doesn't necessarily make for a very well-written book. This book felt much like the author simply took his journal entries, tweaked them a bit, and put them in a book. This is in no way meant to diminish the value of the service, or my appreciation for him and other who have served, or currently serve. I'm not expecting a Black Hawk Down level of experience out of every one of these types of books, but I'd expect the book to be edited better.</p>
