<p>I still really like this book. I listened to it with my wife, and she commented on the profanity, which is certainly there. Despite that, the experiences are well-told, largely entertaining, and surely interesting.  </p>
<p>His audio performance is top notch - truly totally worth it.  </p>
<p>With this being my second listen-through, I knew there wouldn't be an overarching message. Instead, I could sit back and enjoy how he brought in relevant details with each story, to make sure that when you arrived at the climax of a given story (or final punchline) you could enjoy the story to its fullest. Well done.</p>
