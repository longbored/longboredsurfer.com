<p>I've been working in Python 2 for a couple years at this point, and due to various issues I continued to come across, repeatedly found myself referenced to this article. I should have read it earlier. If you're a software developer, or a wannabe, or anywhere in between, it's time to buck up, and read this. Don't wait like I did. It's worth your 10 minutes.</p>
