<p class="meta">Published on 2008-02-22 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>After <a href="/blog/01-down-another-63933-miles-to-go">disposing of our previous car</a>, we bought a new (to us) car from a dealer. So far, we love the car, and it's been a wonderful replacement. My only complaint, isn't with the car itself, but with the dealer from whom we bought it. We have received no less than 5 letters from them thanking us for purchasing the car – from the manager, the service manager, the salesman, the finance guy, and the guy in the service department who puts those paper things on the floor when they bring it in for service. Actually, I don't really know the titles of each of the people... nor do I really care. We got the message though. You're thankful we bought the car from you. Next time, charge me less money and don't thank me – I'll be a happier customer.</p>
