<p>I'm not a runner. It's never been something that has appealed to me. It's endless pain and torment. I feel no joy staring at a long road, down which I've "chosen" to run. All of this dislike aside, Jeff has a great line within this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wake again and again to ourselves in the middle of life somehow, bound to a contract of habit that we don't remember signing. This is the case for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took this on a more spiritual level than he intended, but it applies to everyone. At some point, I hope you live your life intentionally, and don't live it by default.</p>
