<p>Of the various leaders during the Civil War, Grant is one of my favorites (in my top two). He's obviously human, but he made many of the right decisions and the right times - specifically during the war. And while he had some demons he dealt with, I still feel like those that want to focus on his occasional vices are missing the bigger picture. Good effort in his presidency, and fantastic in his life after presidency. I'm okay with U.S. Grant.</p>
