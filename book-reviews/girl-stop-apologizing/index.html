<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Rachel Hollis</b></p>
<p>Rachel has a unique style, and a unique approach to the topics. She's not breaking ground with the concepts, but she's got great energy and simple steps that anybody can follow to potentially make a difference in their lives. Some of it may be be up your alley - some of it may not... but that's to be expected from all of these types of books. I listened to this book, and it's one I immediately wanted to go buy the physical book so I could go back through it and take/make notes and highlights.  </p>
<p>This was for a (voluntary) book club at work. I've read enough reviews of Rachel's "Girl, Wash Your Face" book that I figured I'd give this one a shot. I'm the only male in this book club. I wanted to get her/their perspective, as potentially something I could help my daughters (and wife) with. I didn't know I would get so much out of it for myself.  </p>
<p>I've heard some people don't care for Rachel. I didn't know anything about her, but I just plowed through this book in less than a week, and it's pretty good. She comes across as open, honest, self-admittedly imperfect, but optimistic and encouraging. I've read a number of self-help books, and attended several courses on things like this. I tend to walk away from each one with at least one thing for me to implement. This one isn't any different - it has plenty for me to implement in myself, and encourage in others.</p>
