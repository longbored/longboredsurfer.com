<p>This was a great perspective into post-war Germany. While I still don't really understand how the German people could end up (as a society) doing what they did, this provided great insight into how they attempted to recover from their own atrocities, and try to put their past behind them. This wouldn't be a book for the casual reader, but a great book for enthusiasts of WWII history.</p>
