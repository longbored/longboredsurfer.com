<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b></b></p>
<p>Currently the headline <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/04/11/polar.bear.attack/index.html">here</a> reads “Polar bear attacks woman at Berlin Zoo” but let's take a look at the very first paragraph...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A polar bear attacked a woman at Berlin Zoo Friday afternoon after she climbed a fence and jumped into its habitat during feeding time...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman did <strong>what</strong>? The bears are actively feeding, and the woman climbs a fence then jumps into their habitat, and we're blaming the polar bears for attacking her? Pay no attention to the pure stupidity of the woman, and her brave attempts to remove her genes from the gene pool... let's focus on the bears and the crazy ways they follow their animal instincts.</p>
