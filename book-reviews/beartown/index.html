<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Fredrik Backman</b></p>
<p>This was a really good book. It talks about an awful incident (rape). This is one of those things that I hate reading about, but also know it's important to confront. It'll undoubtedly influence how I raise my sons. At the same time, I hope I never have to deal with something like this with my daughters. Additionally, this book made me further question my own prejudices and behavior. This is the third book I've read from Fredrik Backman. He's so good.</p>
