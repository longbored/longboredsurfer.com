<div class="content"><p>At this point, I've read over 5,000 pages about the Civil War, or things taking place right around it. I don't recommend doing that, unless you truly find it interesting, or are similarly trying to gain an appreciation for one of your grandfather's greatest interests. Though I originally started for the latter reason, it didn't take long to shift to the former, and I'm happy to give you some insight into what might be a good fit for you.</p>
<p>If you're interested in Abraham Lincoln, this is the book for you. It gives so much insight into him, and his maneuverings. What a remarkable person, truly. I don't want to spoil the ending, but I will say I was truly sad with the build-up to the events at Ford's Theater, knowing exactly what was coming. Despite having read this book, I'd love to read another one about Lincoln. Truly, an incredible person.</p>
<p>If you think you might want a decent view into the time period, and maybe a taste of the Civil War itself, then you might consider <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/372298780?book_show_action=false">Battle Cry of Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>If you really want to get into the Civil War, then go for the gold standard - Shelby Foote's gigantic <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/334941644?book_show_action=false">The Civil War</a>. Despite my original lack-luster review, I'm highly tempted to go back through those books. I happened to start with them, and might be a bit much for a first-time Civil War reader.</p></div>
