<p>I attempt to deliver my answer to my father. He has gone MIA and found himself on a golf course and not answering phone calls until after the round.</p>
<p>Sarah calls me twice to find out my answer as well as to shoot around ideas and itineraries. Debate happens as to whether or not a video is required. Alec is left out of the debate, and shoots out an idea for a video. Communication continues to happen throughout the day, and the results settle on this: Alec and I will travel on Saturday to Denver and wait for my father to show up there. We'll sleep there in a quiet room, get up the next day for a 6 AM flight to Washington Dulles. From there, we'll meet up with my uncle and drive up to Philadelphia, and be there at around 4-ish.</p>
