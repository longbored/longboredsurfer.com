	<p class="meta">Published on 2007-09-01</p>
	<p>Surprise!! I took the liberty to redo the recipe collection. I know that nobody asked me to do it, but I did it anyway. This represents some magical happenings by yours truly to incorporate the recipes into their own publishing system. I spent good time to make sure that the old recipe page(s) would automatically lead to their new home (don't forget to update your bookmarks). If it didn't... well... you got here somehow, so... maybe it actually <em>did</em> work.</p>
<p>You may ask, "Why?" and I would say... "Because.". Previously the recipes where housed in their own database, and weren't really all that easy for me to update (hence my lateness in putting up recipes sometimes). I'm kind of tired of doing that, and I wanted to take advantage of some of the cool features of a publishing system. So here's what you get out of the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS/Atom Feed - Tired of checking to see if I've put up the latest recipes? Subscribe to the feed for the recipes, and you'll know automatically when I put up new ones. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)#Atom">Learn about RSS/Atom</a>. I recommend <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google Reader</a>. I really like it (or <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">NetVibes</a>)</li>
<li>Search functions. I tried out a Google Coop search engine for a few days... but I didn't really like it. Sure it fast, but I couldn't go "back" in my browser (thanks to the funky javascript). Kind of annoying. (Plus I, as a site stats lover. couldn't really track my search stats, and I want to know what you as users are searching for so I can hone my site a bit (plus I don't really like ads on my site, like Google did))</li>
<li>The new system will also hopefully encourage me to edit those recipes to clean them up a bit. Don't keep your fingers crossed on that one—it'll take me a lot of time if I do it</li>
<li>Print Formatting – I spent the time to make sure these things would print out in an acceptable format. I only know one person with a computer in their kitchen, and it's not me. We all want these things on paper so we can actually use them. Just go ahead and print. It won't look the same when you print it as it does on your screen. Don't believe me? Preview the print job, and see if it looks good to you. Just a little trickery on my part there (it also cuts back on storage for me not having duplicate pages).</li>
<li>Last but far from least, Comments. To me, food is all about enjoying it with others, and it's nice to be able to leave comments on recipes. Share your thoughts about a recipe, or even ask simple questions. I'm game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you like the new features as well. If so, <a href="/about">drop me a line</a> letting me know. I <strong>very</strong> rarely won't respond, so keep your eyes peeled for that response from me. Happy cooking &amp; eating! :)</p>
