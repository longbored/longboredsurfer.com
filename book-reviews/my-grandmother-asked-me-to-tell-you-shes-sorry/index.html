<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Fredrik Backman</b></p>
<p>This is really good, even for someone who's not almost 8, nor a superhero. This is a clever, charming, humorous, nicely interwoven, yet very straight-forward story, with people and situations that feel comfortably familiar (though never having experienced most of them myself). I'm waiting to find a book by Fredrik Backman that I don't <em>really</em> like.  </p>
<p>An awfully stated, yet accurate premise: A whimsical, slightly rebellious, grandmother and her imaginative, clever, and inquisitive granddaughter, have a fantastic relationship. And there's a wurse.</p>
