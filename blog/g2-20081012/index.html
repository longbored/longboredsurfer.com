	<p><img alt="G2 20081012 - Front" src="g2_20081012_front_400.jpg" />You knew it would happen again. It's been almost a year since I finished the <a href="/blog/g2-20071012">previous G2</a> (this one I finished on 10/10, so I'm one day short of a year). For those of you unfamiliar, the G2's are CD mixes I make for my wonderful wife, Maria. This one was made yet again for our anniversary. You'll never guess how long we've bee married. I like sharing the playlist/song with you, and telling a little about the design of the covers. I reserve the right to tell you what I want about the songs I selected for the album, as usual. Unlike the previous G2, this one didn't have a specific theme, or original set of music from which I selected.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up going with for the album:</p>

<p>The front artwork is at the top of this post, and this fine piece here is the back artwork. Although I made this one for an anniversary, I didn't think it would be all that smart to overly highlight the number of years. One just just imagine a triplicate of that number, and the message that might convey. So, without really being able to play with that theme, I looked elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>Veerle Pieters wrote yet <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/illustrator_make_with_mesh/">another very insightful piece</a> on her blog from which I found I could easily take some inspiration. I avoided using Illustrator, mainly because I'm not very familiar with it, and I was under a bit of a time crunch to get this done. I've been doing more with Illustrator, but now wasn't a good learning time. As usual, Fireworks to the rescue.</li>
<li>Although none of the *cough*default*cough* typefaces are anything to be proud of, that 6 was drawn by yours truly. I'd be curious to do spend more time drawing characters/glyphs for a typeface. I don't have the eye to make the next Helvetica, but I might have some fun with it.</li>
<li><a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Kuler</a> gave me my color theme (I wish I had a link to the specific theme, but alas, my brain was elsewhere when I found it). Because I know you're curious, here's a simple strip for your color-picker purposes:</li>
</ul>

<p>If there's any comfort in this album, it's in my commitment not to wait so long to make the next installment. Admitedly, I listened to a lot of books in the previous year, so I wasn't listening to as much music. Now that I've finished that insanely long series of books, I'm back to listening to music.</p>
