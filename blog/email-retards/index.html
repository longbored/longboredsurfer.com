<p>The clip of the dancing trombone player, babies spitting up, the fruitcake lady, foreign commercials, sports bloopers, every joke imaginable, how hell is exothermic, whatever. One "friend" sent you all of those emails. You've seen each of those emails and you know they're coming again, because this one friend is a total retard when it comes to email.</p>
<p>Driving requires a license. CPR requires certification (though nobody is going to stop you from trying if you're the only one around with a clue and you don' t happen to be certified). Drinking alcoholic beverages requires somebody to be of age. Emailing jokes to everybody you know multiple times requires an IQ of about 4 (okay, probably in the area of 80 or 90, but let's not be technical).</p>
<p>Since each of us have some friend who feels obligated to send us the email about Bill Gates giving you money if you forward the email to everybody you know, let's take some action on this. This person is obviously oblivious (whoa, say that 10 times fast) to the rest of us and the number of emails that we've gotten throughout our online experience.</p>
<p>What I'm proposing is not a license to email. James Bond would have his way with that sort of dictatorship (phallus, potato, sailing vessel). What I'm suggesting is an email mentorship. The last thing we really want is to get all of those emails yet again. If we liked them the first time, we probably saved them. </p>
<p>If you're new to the email system, ask an old timer (by phone or in person) if they have received the email in question previously. Repeat this process for at least 2 other people (three total). If any of those people respond in the affirmative, you aren't allowed to send that email.</p>
<p>Email retards don't get to use a special shorter computer, they don't get people to wait on them in the ratio of 3:1. They might have people despise them in the ratio of 20:1 if they send out these emails. Do us all a favor, and ask a buddy before sending that email.</p>
