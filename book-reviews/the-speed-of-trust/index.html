<p>Lots to think about from this book. I appreciate the evidence of trust-based relationships. In that "which came first - the chicken or the egg" debate around trust ("Should they be trustworthy first, or should I trust them first?"), I can attest to how hard it is to extending trust repeatedly to those who repeatedly violate it. Regardless, an interesting perspective, and it has helped me to review my relationships ever since.</p>
