<p>If I could give a book six stars, I would do so to this book. With one in three people being an introvert, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I'm not a shy person, but I'm still introverted more often than not. I found this book to be extremely insightful both into myself, as well as those that exhibit more/deeper introversion than I.</p>
