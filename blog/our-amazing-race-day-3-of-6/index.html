	<p class="meta">Published on 2005-03-19 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
	<p>If only we knew the pandemonium that we were about to enter, we might not have even started. Following <a href="/blog/our-amazing-race-alecs-video-i">Alec's idea</a> for the video (and seeing the need for a team name and logo) the day began. I created a <a href="/blog/our-amazing-race-logo">logo</a> for our new team, The Globe Walkers, and emailed that out for people's viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>Alec and I got started on recording our part of that video at about 2 PM. We got footage of us introducing ourselves in various ways. We recorded a funny scene of me running towards the car, as if our race had already started. We recorded some of the footage on the way to the airport. I found a copy of The Amazing Race theme song (which I hope they don't mind that we borrowed), and got ready for something insane.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sarah recorded some footage of her in downtown Philadelphia. Sadly, we didn't use very much of her footage. Later you'll see our end product, and you'll see what we did end up using.</p>
<p>At the airport we get additional footage (none of which we used), and make it to Denver without any issues, sitting in 1A and 1B.</p>
<p>Denver is exactly what we suspected. Alec has an idea of recording us running down some of the moving walkways (in opposite directions no less). Our video escapades end soon after that, since an idea has been proposed: find another way to get to Philadelphia. The Dulles flight the next morning doesn't look very good, and it would be better if we tried our luck elsewhere.</p>
<p>We're told to look for ways to get to Philadelphia, Allentown, or Dulles. Alec sticks it out at the Customer Service Desk and I try to find somebody else to help us. I find a very nice desk worker who's gate was empty, and she only confirms what Alec ends up finding out as well. Alec gets help from a lady who takes him into a back room to look a options. Things just don't look good. It's getting late enough that flights are limited, and the next morning's flights aren't any better than the Dulles one.</p>
<p>Flying standby on United is always entertaining. We settle on something: we should try to get on a flight to Chicago. This Chicago flight (last time we checked) was overbooked by 15 or so, and already had 50 (yes fifty) standby's listed. It's a total shot in the dark. The lady at the gate isn't encouraging, but we tell her we'll stick it out until the very end.</p>
<p>In short, we are nearly the last two people on the plane. Amazed at our luck, we take advantage of it, and bid farewell to Denver. Squeezed on a packed plane, we make it to Chicago. Now you may wonder what the difference would be between Chicago and Denver, and I'll tell you. The flight from Chicago to Philadelphia the next morning was wide open and we were pretty much guaranteed to be on it. The flights from Denver to Dulles weren't that great, and we still would have had to drive from Dulles to Philadelphia. On the flight in seats 15B and 17C, we head off into the night.</p>
