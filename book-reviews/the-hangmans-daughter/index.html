<p class="stars">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>This is a solid 3-star book, but the historical nature of the book, and the elements of truth to it, bump it up a star for me. The story itself was decent, and admittedly had me wondering/guessing at a variety of places. That said, it was also a bit all over the place.  </p>
<p>I was interested to read about the shunned nature of the hangman, and others in "less-reputable" lines of work - it was something I had never really considered about that particular line of work. It's hard to remember just how long ago (or not so long ago) some rather horrendous medical practices were common-place.</p>
