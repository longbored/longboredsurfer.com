<p>Bret Victor gives us another very thoughtful essay on programming (which I admit has been opened as a tab in my browser for the past five months). I admit I'm a person who has tried to learn to program several times, and (in my opinion) failed every time, despite being able to accomplish all of the prescribed activities. Now don't get me wrong, Bret doesn't offer some miracle solution that makes it so we can all program, but I really like his examples and encouragements. All of it may be the real reason why I've taken so well to SQL - my mind has easily taken to visualizing data in that way.</p>
