<p>Part of me simply can't believe that Elizabeth Holmes isn't in prison. The web of lies, deception, secrecy, and audacity it took to make this series of events happen is somewhat baffling. I read this for a book club, and part of the conversation evolved around whether she was lying the whole time, or simply got caught up in the moment... for years. Also, it's interesting to see a "reality distortion field" at play - too bad it was a load of garbage.</p>
