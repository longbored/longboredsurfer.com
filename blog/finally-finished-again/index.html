	<p>I think I've finally finished this site. It took long enough, but this time I'm really serious. The addition of the longbored photos is nice, but wasn't the finishing touch. No, the finishing touch you should hopefully never see. It would be the error page.</p>
<p>Every site has an error page. They're a little message to tell the visitor that they've entered in, or requested a page that doesn't exist. For those of you curious, or already knowing, the error code is 404. If you're so inclined to see the new error page, just type in some random junk after the site address, and it'll generate that new happy error page for you. If you get offended by it... you're hyper-sensitive. If you're more curious, a good deal of the inspiration for my 404 page (which needs work, but at least it looks like the rest of the site) came from <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/404error.html">here</a>.</p>
