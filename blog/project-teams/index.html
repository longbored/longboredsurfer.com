<p>Have you ever been included on a project then never really felt like you were actually on the project? Sometimes there are meetings that are happening that you feel like you should be part of, but for some reason you're not invited. Sometimes you overhear or witness conversations and think to yourself, "Should I be listening to that, or even taking part?" There are of course the other kind of projects that aren't official, yet you still feel like you should be part of, but you're not.</p>
<p>Office politics and quirks sometimes are pretty annoying. I'm glad we have <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">a TV show</a> which points most of them out so we can laugh awkwardly and go, "yeah... I wish that weren't so true."</p>
