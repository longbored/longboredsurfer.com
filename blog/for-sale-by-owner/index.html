<p>I was approached to create a simple site to aide in the selling of a home. Though originally I think they only wanted a page or two (like the vast majority of sites like that), I decided to give them a bit more for the money, and add a couple slick features. You can check out an example of the site (for the time being) <a href="/portfolio">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll admit that what I really like about the site is the integration of Google Maps and PHP. The local attractions is a nice touch, since you can click on any of the pre-determined points, and it'll tell you whatever I want about the place (like in the examples, it shows driving distance). The "Get Directions" thing is pretty handy. I was really aiming for a way to display the results right there in the same window, but it was driving me nuts, and not really worth the effort.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Blogger for lending me the template. I resorted to Simple PHP Gallery, since Plogger is giving me headaches. Plogger turns out to be less than helpful when trying to sort pictures in a way that you want. Simple PHP Gallery is perfect for something like this though.</p>
<p>I'm pleased with my use of PHP in here. Despite the temptations, I didn't use Movable Type to build this site, but just did it all by hand. Seeing a good chance to be able to re-use code in multiple places, I opted to insert dinky code in places.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\&lt;?php $pageTitle \= "This page title gets reused";?&gt;
So, with some simple code, then recalling that code later (like this: \&lt;?php echo $pageTitle; ?&gt; ) I could change the title to the page in one place, then it'd be changed everywhere else it's used. I love it. The sidebar was another nice touch of PHP by being able to separate out the various parts of the sidebar and use it as I please. The final little touch is the date that displays on the site. It updates automatically, without any help from me. Not too shabby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, I'm pleased with the site. It looks pretty decent, and I like the color scheme. Good learning experience with a couple things. I validated the XHTML and CSS so it looks nice, technically speaking. Add that to an easy ability to create the pages and content...... it's pretty slick.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to buy the place, go check it out.</p>

Site disabled, but at least a copy of the page can be found in the <a href="/portfolio">Longbored Portfolio</a>.</p>
