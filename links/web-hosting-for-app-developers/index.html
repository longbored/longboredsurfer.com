<p>This was all over my corner of the interwebs a few weeks ago. I'm not an app developer (yet?), but I value the simple advice for setting up a web server. For a year I tried one of those hosts he mentions. I actually <em>really</em> liked it, but couldn't justify the cost considering this website is... well, it's not like it's making me rich, or even paying for itself at this point. At any rate, Marco's advice is solid, to the point of making we want to give it another shot, if for nothing else than the speed of a VPS.</p>
