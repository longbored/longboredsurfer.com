<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b></b></p>
<p>If I just met you for the first time, I would be happy to shake your hand, given that you had a hand to be shaken. I'm not talking about an overt attempt to remove your hand by psychotic shaking. I'm referring to the general gripping of a hand in a friendly/business-like manner and acknowledging that I am aware of your presence.</p>
<p>Some locations are more prone to hand-shaking than others. One would probably be more likely to shake hands in church, on a business trip, or when seeing an old friend after an extended period of time.</p>
<p>If I see you every day, and several times a day, I feel little to no obligation to shake your hand. That would mean that I don't shake your hand each day. I don't shake your hand each time I see you. I don't shake your hand after you get back from vacation. I don't shake your hand. Please note the period at the end of the last statement.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a way to show me that you're fond of me in a friendly way, or that you're glad to see me, I could agree to a head gesture of some fashion, maybe a friendly greeting, possibly a quick pat on the shoulder. I don't see the point, however, of shaking my hand throughout the day. I'm glad that you like me. I'm glad that we're friends. I'm honored that you feel like you can shake my hand.</p>
<p>Don't do it. Since I've spent so much time talking about how you can't shake my hand, lets end this on a positive note.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for which you could shake my hand:</strong>
* New child is expected
* Promotion
* Long project was just completed
* Saying goodbye for a long time
* Pretending to have just met for the first time</p>
