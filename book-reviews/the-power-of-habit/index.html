<p>Super intersting insight into habits, and how they're formed. The concept is really straight-forward. You receive a cue/trigger, which leads to a routine, and a reward, which encourages the same cycle. They key in changing habits is noticing what those cues are, and trying to divert them to other habits (with rewards). There were lots of interesting stories, and case-studies, so the book felt like an engaging read. I wish he would have spent more time than the handful of pages in the afterword talking about how to implement things - though if you don't get inspired by all the stories he's shared, I guess that's on you/me.</p>
