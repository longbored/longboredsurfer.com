<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Vince Flynn</b></p>
<p>I felt this was a return to Flynn's fairly predictable ways. Sure, I enjoyed the book, and the story kept me on edge. It took too long for me to see where the book was going, and once that was made obvious, there wasn't enough to actually build on that. I look forward to his next release in October of this year.</p>
