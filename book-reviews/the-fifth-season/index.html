<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>N.K. Jemisin</b></p>
<p>This book had engaging storylines, unique points of view, an interesting world, and a slightly different magic system. All of those elements helped bring me into the story, and go through this book rather quickly. I have already happily started the second book.  </p>
<p>I'll share my usual points of contention, however: unnecessary (though admittedly not super graphic) sex, and seemingly out of place and excessive vulgarity. You've invented cuss words for your world? Okay. They start saying F this and that? Wait - so, why bother inventing new ones, too?</p>
