<p>Jon Bellion is relatively new (and unknown) to me. I've enjoyed a number of his songs, and knew nothing about him. Though long, this podcast episode was fantastic, and filled with lots of nuggets of wisdom both from Jon himself, as well as Ross Golan. I simply don't think about lots of the things these guys were talking about, and I loved it.</p>
