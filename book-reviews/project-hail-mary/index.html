<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Andy Weir</b></p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. In fact, I listened to it (a 16 hour book) in two days. That's how much I enjoyed it. The author, Andy Weir, does a great job of mixing in just enough science to help me feel like I know what's going on. It felt Crichton-esque, in terms of giving me enough science to help me feel educated on things, but at some point the step into fiction takes places seamlessly enough to not have me question it.  </p>
<p>In this book, the author does a great job in his story-telling of keeping current events flowing, while weaving in prior events to give a complete picture.  </p>
<p>tl;dr If you liked The Martian, you'll probably enjoy this.</p>
