<p>I sure enjoyed Garbage Pail Kids when I was younger. I really like the concept of these "Where are they Now" variety (no matter how disturbing it might be to see some of them in a more realistic version than the cartoon/doll-based variety). And, I love how they've made a couple of the characters be professionally active with their... ability/condition. Be sure to see them all at the the website of <a href="http://brutonstroube.com/portfolios/stills/all/portraits">Jake Houvenagle Brandon Voges</a>.</p>
