<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Bill Bryson</b></p>
<p>Bill Bryson is somehow both thoroughly detailed, yet so brief as to leave me wanting more. I learned so many tidbits from this book (and was fascinated by so many of them), it's hard for me to recall any single one of them while I write this. I anticipate that for quite some time I'll spout off random facts or insights about the body, as things naturally come up in conversation.</p>
