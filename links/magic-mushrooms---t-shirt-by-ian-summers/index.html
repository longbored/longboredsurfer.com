<p>Great t-shirt that just might need to join my wardrobe. While we're on the topic of video games... I think Super Mario Brothers 2 was such an enlightening game, since I still think of the jumping style of each of the characters, based upon on they originally performed in that game. The two characters on this t-shirt (Toad and Luigi) were my two favorite characters in that game, very closely followed by Princess Peach. Sorry... back to your regularly scheduled links.</p>
