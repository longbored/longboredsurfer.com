<p>A great book - if you’ve read the others in this series. I listened to this book two times in a row. The ending came too quickly the first time, and I knew I had missed some details along the way. Even while listening to it the second time, I thought, “I really like how he writes.” While I’m sad there’s so much time between books, I surely enjoy the final products. Bast is more of a favorite than before.</p>
