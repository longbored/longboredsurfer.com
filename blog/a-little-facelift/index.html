<p>The Long<em>bored</em> Surfer just got a little face-lift. If you're using a feed reader (I love <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google Reader</a>) and haven't stopped by since I last posted, it might be worth your time. This isn't the full redesign I talked about <a href="/blog/site-revamp-again">before</a>, but it's something with which I'm satisfied, especially considering the time investment. I'm not going to bore you all with the details of my plans â€“ I did that before. I think this is a very good/solid starting point. I anticipate moving all my old remaining content off of the old format soon. Ever since I upgraded to Movable Type 4, I feel like I haven't done as much on this site as I wanted to, and I intend to change that. I enjoy doing this sort of stuff too much.</p>
<p>On another note, if you do read this site through a feed reader, you may notice that I fixed the formatting issues I was having. Previously all the text was bunched together for a reason I didn't know. Well, thanks to <a href="http://jayseae.cxliv.org/2007/10/05/how_to_fix_a_common_mt4_feed_formatting_error.php">a tip</a> on how to fix that. It took me how long to make such a simple fix? Shameful, I know. That's all.</p>
