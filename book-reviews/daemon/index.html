<p>Don't read chapter 4. If you start it, once they get to the rave, just skip to the next chapter. I'm serious. Having been warned of it, but still catching a glimpse, it's truly awful (explicit, depraved, and horrendously pornographic). I'm glad I could get that out of the way, because otherwise it was an enjoyable book, though quite profane.  </p>
<p>A genius programmer has died, and built a self-running/triggering piece of software that attempts to implement a meritocracy across the entire world, recruiting people to its cause. What a boring description of an otherwise engaging book. This felt like a good 'ol Michael Crichton sci-fi novel - taking science and technology we're already familiar with, maybe introducing things to us we weren't aware of, and pushing it just a bit farther into the area of fiction, where you're not quite sure what's real/possible, and what's completely false.  </p>
<p>Despite chapter four, and one other scene of marital infidelity, I enjoyed the book - setting up heroes and villains - but never quite sure which is which.</p>
