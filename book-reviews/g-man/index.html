<p>Much like the author, "I do not count myself among Hoover's admirers." I've been somewhat aware of his significant influence on 20th-century American politics. I've see his name mentioned in enough other books that I was curious about this book - but the Pulitzer awarded to this book helped seal the deal. Many of Hoover's methods and stances aren't things I agree with. But he had influence on and support from eight US presidents. Furthermore, given his personal life, I think he was more nuanced, and conflicted than some might acknowledge. This is an interesting book, though it's not for the feint of heart - it's a behemoth. Regardless, the author did a fantastic job of carrying me along in Hoover's life. The significant oversteps Hoover took were on full display here, and yet I'm still curious to see what still-embargoed things remain to be learned about this polarizing man.</p>
