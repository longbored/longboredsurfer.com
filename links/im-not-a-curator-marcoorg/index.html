<p>I know I haven't posted in a while, but I couldn't agree more with Marco's thoughts about the <a href="http://www.curatorscode.org/">Curator's Code</a>. My favorite piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...that’s how I feel about links in general: the source author creates something worth linking to, and the rest of us can link as we see fit, regardless of how we found it.</p>
<p>The proper place for ethics and codes is in ensuring that a reasonable number of people go to the source instead of just reading your rehash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I obviously don't spend a lot of time looking for things for you to read, but both his style, and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber's</a> style is what I've tried to follow.</p>
