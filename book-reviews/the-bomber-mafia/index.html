<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Malcolm Gladwell</b></p>
<p>The book was interesting on its focused topic. It talk about two different approaches to bombing during the war, with some context and background to those approaches, and some key players.  </p>
<p>I've been on a bit of a run lately with World War 2 books. That said, this book was part of a book club, and with its length, I don't think I would have proactively picked this book to expand on my WWII repetoire.  </p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell clearly enjoys the audio format. The incorporation of original audio from interviews, radio, speeches, etc. is great for the audiobook junky in me. That said, at barely more than 5 hours, this book is really short, and probably better as a (subscription) podcast series.  </p>
<p>Also, although he reaches some conclusion at the end of the book, given the duration of the war in Afghanistan, I would argue against his conclusion. War - always a messy business, and atrocious in its own ways.</p>
