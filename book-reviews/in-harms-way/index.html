<p>tl;dr: Well-written. Not as action-packed as other books. Still interesting. Worth the time.  </p>
<p>Wow - some elements of this were particularly harrowing. I mean, we've read Undaunted, and know about the sharks, in the South Pacific, but this is next level stuff here. I can't really imagine stuff like this happening. It sure adds an element to my gratitude for those that serve in the Armed Forces.</p>
