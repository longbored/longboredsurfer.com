<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>If you're into fantasy, I'd certainly recommend this book. Brandon Sanderson's books (or series) are very interesting to me, since each one uses a different system of magic (and religion, but that's less interesting to me). I don't generally think in terms of the impossible (magic), so I'm continually surprised at how things evolve. An enjoyable book, with well-developed characters. I'm looking forward to the other two books in this series.</p>
