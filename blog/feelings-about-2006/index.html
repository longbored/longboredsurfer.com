<h1><a href="/blog/20061220-feelings-about-2006">Feelings about 2006</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2006-12-20 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>Despite the fact that I publish things on the internet and allow pretty much anybody to read it, I'm still a fairly private person. This year is about to come to a close and I've experienced far more than I've talked about on this blog.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy both my desire to share with you and my tendency towards privacy, I've come up with a solution. I'd like to share with you some of the feelings, thoughts, descriptions, and whatnot that I might use to describe various experiences and times that I've had throughout the year. Take this for what it's worth: (in no particular order)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hope, joy, anxiety, fear, ignorance, sorrow, uncertainty, happy, sadness, relaxed, rested, embarrassment, discontent, shame, relief, strength, humor, pleasure, delighted, boredom, misunderstanding, displeasure, challenged, questioned, overloaded, burdened, awestruck, gratitude, cheated, shortchanged, guilty, tested, loved, admiration, jealousy, confusion, wonder, amazement, enlightened, curiosity, satisfaction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure there are others, but that's a decent start. Despite the hard times in 2006, it was a very beneficial year and look forward to 2007.</p>
<p>Sorry it's taken me so long to post stuff. There's been a lot going on, and I haven't made this a priority.</p>
