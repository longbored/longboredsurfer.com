<p>I frustrate my direct supervisor at work, in part because I hate goals, and I verbalize my disapproval of them. My nuanced feelings about goals and the deadlines frequently associated with them can't fit into an entry like this. That said, I agree with a lot of what James Clear has to say about goals. One of those that has bitten our team most recently is this shortcoming of goals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You canâ€™t predict the future. (I know, shocking.)</p>
<p>But every time we set a goal, we try to do it. We try to plan out where we will be and when we will make it there. We try to predict how quickly we can make progress, even though we have no idea what circumstances or situations will arise along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really though, you should read the whole article. It's well-written, and I'm curious to read his newsletters going forward.</p>
