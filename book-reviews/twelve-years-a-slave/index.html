<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Solomon Northup</b></p>
<p>Paul Stout recommended this book to me, saying it should be required reading for all school children. I completely agree (in the same way as I would recommend "Night" by Elie Wiesel). What a fascinating view into the peculiar institution of slavery. It's hard to believe that such atrocities were carried out on fellow human beings. That being said, Solomon "Platt" Northup is such a great person, a natural narrator of his experiences, and worthy of emulating in a variety of ways.</p>
