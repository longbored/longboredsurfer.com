<p>I really like DKNG's work, and own multiple prints from them. I also have a soft spot for patches (though, admittedly, I never do anything with them, apart from put them in a little "happy box", and look at them every now and then). As it is, the venn diagram represented by this new patch essentially guaranteed I would buy it. $6? Done.</p>
