<div class="content"><p>This is a perfect next step in the series. This is a series that deserves being read in order. Plus, all of the books should be read. Read my review of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1316410061">the prior book</a> before this.</p>
<p>This book introduces so many key elements - subversive/hidden enemies, an invading (vastly different) nation, develops the nature of the shadow, a key piece of historical relevance, and much more. I continue to love the character development. One thing the three boys each have in common is how reluctant they are to accept their "fate" or role. Each of them continually pushes it off, which is much more how I think it would play out in real life. Not everybody wants to fully accept some new grandiose role in the world, and each of these boys is so reluctant to accept their role, it feels very familiar.</p>
<p>I admit I love the time Egwene spends with the Seanchan. It's such a different culture, and their ideas and approaches are a stark contrast to how The White Tower, and the rest of their (familiar) world. I love how they introduce dark friends, and how they can be _anywhere_. Watching Salene completely befuddle the boys is also amusing. Lastly, I love how Mat blows the horn - not Rand. It helps spread out some of the fun.</p>
<p>If you haven't read any of the books, and you enjoy fiction, I can't recommend the first book in the series enough - Fantasy isn't what you think it is.</p></div>
