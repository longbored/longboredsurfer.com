<p>I wish this was a longer story. Although the story is personal for the main character, it felt like there could have been so much more. I admittedly listened to this novella - mainly because I listened to a sample, and heard the reader's pronunciation of names, and accents given for different characters, and knew it would be worth my time. My hopes didn't lead me astray.</p>
