<p>This was a great, and rather quick read about some of the history of a company that makes some of my favorite products. This is an excerpt of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062276697/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062276697&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thelongsurf-20&amp;linkId=LZKVJBLWJL2TORUA">Console Wars</a>, by Blake Harris. I knew Nintendo started as a playing card "company", but didn't know the pieces in between (nor the interesting lawsuit by MCA Universal in regards to King Kong). I'd be curious to know if the book is as good as this one excerpt. (credit to my brother for sending me this article nearly two months ago)</p>
