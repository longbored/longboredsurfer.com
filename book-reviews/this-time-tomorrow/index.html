<p>The premise of the book sounds cheesy - a newly middle-aged woman time travels / wakes up as herself at 16 and chooses to focus on her father. In reality, the book felt more like a combination of "How can small changes now make a big impact later" (like Back to the Future), and focusing on what matters. It's a quick read, and some of the anything-goes attitude of the characters felt implausible... but it's a book with time travel. I think my mother would like this one - for more than just the time travel aspect.</p>
