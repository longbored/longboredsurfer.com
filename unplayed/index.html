<h1>Unplayed</h1>
<p>For a future date in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future <span>DS</span> <span>Though I'm debating any of these again. The story drags me down. I just want the puzzles.</span></li>
<li>Professor Layton and the Spector's Flute <span>DS</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Unbeaten</h1>
<p>Games in various stages of being played, not <em>yet</em> abandoned</p>
<ul>
<li>Minecraft <span>OS X</span> <span>Technically unbeatable...ish.</span></li>
<li>Limbo <span>OS X</span> <span>The black and white freaks me out, but it's fun.</span></li>
<li>Beat Sneak <span>iOS</span> <span>Will probably end up on the abandoned list, although I really like it</span></li>
<li>Whitewater Wipeout <span>Playdate</span> <span>This took me a while to really get a hang of - no pun intended. Super simple dynamic. Endless.</span></li>
<li>Hyper Meteor <span>Playdate</span> <span>Asteroids, with a twist. I enjoy this one, but won't be addicted to it. Endless?</span></li>
<li>Snak <span>Playdate</span> <span>Snake, with a twist. Endless. Though, I didn't get pulled into this one either.</span></li>
<li>Forrest Byrnes: Up in Smoke <span>Playdate</span> <span>Firewatch? Sign me up. This endless side-scrolling platformer didn't grab me.</span></li>
<li>b360 <span>Playdate</span> <span>Endless. The crank mechanics were too much for me. Plus, the other game this week, Ratcheteer, totally sucked me in, and I never came back to this.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Beaten</h1>
<p>Various levels of thoroughness, or number of times. A very incomplete list when it comes to older and/or portable games.</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Bros. 2 <span>NES</span> <span>First video game I ever beat</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. <span>NES</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. 3 <span>NES</span> <span>I made index cards for the N-cards on this</span></li>
<li>Commando <span>NES</span></li>
<li>Paperboy <span>NES</span></li>
<li>Super Mario World <span>SNES</span> <span>96 Stars, every. single. time.</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Link to the Past <span>SNES</span> <span>Possibly my favorite game of all time</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time <span>N64</span> <span>Not my favorite</span></li>
<li>Mario Kart Double Dash <span>GC</span> <span>Loved the two-player coop mode</span></li>
<li>Animal Crossing <span>GC</span> <span>Technically abandoned, but there's no end to the game. I still have the best town name <em>ever</em>&hellip; Mianus.</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Strikers <span>GC</span></li>
<li>Mario Superstar Baseball <span>GC</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker <span>GC</span> <span>Loved the cell shading. This game still holds up in the days of much better graphics.</span></li>
<li>Midway Arcade Treasures <span>GC</span> <span>Technically abandoned</span></li>
<li>Namco Museum <span>GC</span> <span>Technically abandoned</span></li>
<li>Mario Golf Toadstool Tour <span>GC</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Advance <span>GBA</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Advance 2 <span>GBA</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Advance 3 <span>GBA</span> <span>Might have liked this better than the original Yoshi's Island</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Advance 4 <span>GBA</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - The Minish Cap <span>GBA</span> <span>Beat it, but left lots undone</span></li>
<li>Aladdin <span>GBA</span> <span>Liked the original on SNES. No differences here.</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Ages <span>GBC</span> <span>Despite playing it several years after the release, I still enjoyed it</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Twilight Princess <span>GC</span> <span>Better camera control than the Wii</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy <span>Wii</span> <span>Never beat it as Luigi. No interest.</span></li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros <span>DS</span> <span>Loved it</span></li>
<li>Mario Kart DS <span>DS</span> <span>Don't bother playing online</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Twilight Princess <span>Wii</span> <span>Better archery control than the GameCube</span></li>
<li>Yoshi's Island DS <span>DS</span> <span>Great new take on a classic game</span></li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros. Wii <span>Wii</span></li>
<li>Mario Party 8 <span>Wii</span> <span>Technically abandoned, but I don't care</span></li>
<li>Guitar Hero World Tour <span>Wii</span></li>
<li>Rockband 2 <span>Wii</span> <span>Meh</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Phantom Hourglass <span>DS</span> <span>Beat it twice all the way through</span></li>
<li>Mario Kart Wii <span>Wii</span> <span>Ended as a 1-star player. Good enough. Ditch the wheel.</span></li>
<li>The Beatles Rockband <span>Wii</span> <span>Loved it, but I'm a Beatles freak</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Spirit Tracks <span>DS</span> <span>Too much train riding, but still fun.</span></li>
<li>Braid <span>OS X</span> <span>Loved the ability to mess with time</span></li>
<li>Professor Layton and the Curious Village <span>DS</span> <span>Didn't get <em>all</em> coins, but enough</span></li>
<li>VVVVVV <span>OS X</span> <span>loved the unlimited-lives-because-who-really-cares-about-that-part-of-the-game part</span></li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy 2 <span>Wii</span> <span>They fixed some quirks from the original. Loved it.</span></li>
<li>Zelda Skyward Sword <span>Wii</span> <span>Initially very resistant to the mechanics, but eventually fell head-over-heels in love with this. Will most likely end up playing it again soon.</span></li>
<li>Mario Kart 7 <span>3DS</span> <span>I continue to love how they bring back old/legacy tracks.</span></li>
<li>Super Mario 3D Land <span>3DS</span> <span>Though I'm generally not a fan of the 3D part of the 3DS, I played most of this with the 3D enabled, because it was so well done.</span></li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros. 2 <span>3DS</span> <span>Much easier than I thought it'd be, but I'm not a million-coin-getter. Still fun.</span></li>
<li>Wizorb <span>OS X</span> <span>The keyboard controls are lame, but once I started using the mouse I was dominant.</span></li>
<li>The Last Rocket <span>OS X</span> <span>This is a much more responsive game using a keyboard than usual iOS, but either is very functional. Simple to understand, tricky to master.</span></li>
<li>Super Clew Land <span>OS X</span> <span>Great feel. Simple concept. Good fun.</span></li>
<li>Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box <span>DS</span> <span>Finished, but got bored.</span></li>
<li>Portal <span>OS X</span> <span>Awesome, though short, game. Really enjoyed it.</span></li>
<li>Casual Birder <span>Playdate</span> <span>Unintuitive camera focus mechanism. Still, finished within a week.</span></li>
<li>Crankin Presents Time Travel Adventure <span>Playdate</span> <span>I really enjoyed this one. I think the perfect level of tricky, and perfect length.</span></li>
<li>Lost Your Marbles <span>Playdate</span> <span>I'm torn. Although I like the story, I didn't like it enough for the various replays to get the variations. It needed more levels.</span></li>
<li>Pick Pack Pup <span>Playdate</span> <span>I thought this was a perfect little game for this device. Good balance of story and game - and enjoyed the various themes within the levels.</span></li>
<li>DemonQuest 85 <span>Playdate</span> <span>Kind of a funny concept to me. I anticipate there are multiple ways this game could be finished. I doubt I'll try another path.</span></li>
<li>Omaze <span>Playdate</span> <span>I really liked this one. Built nicely on itself. Just enough variation in the levels, and an obvious completion point of the game. One of my favorites in a while.</span></li>
<li>Executive Golf DX <span>Playdate</span> <span>Easy and approachable. I played through it once, and I can easily see myself playing it again - which I have.</span></li>
<li>Saturday Edition <span>Playdate</span> <span>This was fun. I was pulled in by the story, and the problems felt solvable to me. A+</span></li>
<li>Ratcheteer <span>Playdate</span> <span>I was very excited for this game, and it didn't disappoint. Made by Shaun Inman, of whom I'm a fan, this one is a top-down game, in the style of Zelda, that pulled me in. Loved it. It built on itself really well.</span></li>
<li>Resonant Tale <span>Playdate</span> <span>Made in <a href="https://play.date/pulp/">Pulp</a>, which blows my mind. Fun game. To its credit, this brought me back to Playdate.</span></li>
<li>Dig! Dig! Dino! <span>Playdate</span> <span>Pleasant, casual dig up dino bones game. Keep your eye on the prize.</span></li>
<li>Wheelsprung <span>Playdate</span> <span>Like old school Linerider, except you can at least control the speed and tilt of the rider. Watch out for hazards. 'RollerCoaster' nearly landed this game in Abandoned. Really fun.</span></li>
<li>The Whiteout <span>Playdate</span> <span>I'm not really a fan of post-apocalyptic depictions. Despite that, this was well done. I'm glad they've added the ability to walk a bit faster. I'd be interested to try for another ending.</span></li>
<li>Otto's Galactic Groove!! <span>Playdate</span> <span>Guitar Hero-like game, but using the crank to move which notes are being played. It's a fun implementation, and was enjoyable. I've played some of the side-songs as well, and increased the difficulty. I doubt I'll play this extensively, but it's worth a playthrough.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Abandoned</h1>
<p>Nowhere near completion, mainly for lack of interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kid Icarus <span>NES</span> <span>The first game I ever said "I don't understand this dumb game."</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Majora's Mask <span>N64</span> <span>Never made decent headway, and didn't really care</span></li>
<li>Mario Kart Super Circuit <span>GBA</span> <span>Wonky controls</span></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Seasons <span>GBC</span> <span>Played it 10 years after its release. Got bored</span></li>
<li>Advance Wars <span>GBA</span> <span>Originally started on an emulator, then bought the cartridge &amp; lost interest</span></li>
<li>RetroGame Challenge <span>DS</span> <span>Fun, but it never sucked me in</span></li>
<li>Donkey Kong Country Returns <span>Wii</span> <span>Poor gameplay mechanics</span></li>
<li>The Incident <span>OS X</span> <span>Restarted at some point, and lost interest.</span></li>
<li>Boogie Loops <span>Playdate</span> <span>Just not for me. I dinked around with it for a while, but lost interest very quickly.</span></li>
<li>Flipper Lifter <span>Playdate</span> <span>I played this one for a while, but crank felt less responsive in this game, when I was trying to hustle around to do things. I won't finish this one.</span></li>
<li>Echoic Memory <span>Playdate</span> <span>This game is much better with headphones, or on great speakers. We had fun playing this one as a group as well, since people could pay attention to different elements of the various songs. Just got too hard. Fun concept, though.</span></li>
<li>Zipper <span>Playdate</span> <span>Turn-based strategy, immediately difficult, with zero room for error, and little explanation: this isn't my thing.</span></li>
<li>Questy Chess <span>Playdate</span> <span>I don't really care for chess. In games, for the balance of chance versus skill, it's entirely on the latter, and that's not "fun" to me. I'm out.</span></li>
<li>Star Sled <span>Playdate</span> <span>A bit too high-paced, or maybe precise for me. Plus, I got sucked in by the other game from this week.</span></li>
<li>Spellcorked <span>Playdate</span> <span>More laid-back of a game, that took full use of the crank, but I didn't really end up biting on this one.</span></li>
<li>Inventory Hero <span>Playdate</span> <span>I could see what they were going for here, but the pace of the game, and some of the precision of it all didn't end up pulling me in.</span></li>
<li>Sasquatchers <span>Playdate</span> <span>I enjoyed this one, but I also tend to struggle with turn-based games like these. I ended up losing interest.</span></li>
<li>Battleship Godios <span>Playdate</span> <span>Quickly lost interest.</span></li>
<li>Pokémon Go <span>iOS</span> <span>I played this for years - got to level 43 with excess XP - then realized how much of a waste of time it was.</span></li>
<li>Shadowgate PD <span>Playdate</span> <span>I opened the door to the castle, and walked in, and that's as far as I could get. No key. Just two locked doors. I spent an hour in that entryway trying things. I'm obviously missing something.</span></li>
