<p>This was more a mini biography of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, mixed with the author's theory of how these four men helped form the American colonies into a united nation (when as colonies, their only united goal was to separate from England). It was interesting, but far from the best I've read about Washington and Hamilton. Ron Chernow's books on those two are unmatched, in my opinion. Interesting, but also veering from the point at times.</p>
