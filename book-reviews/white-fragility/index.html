<p>Wow. This was a great perspective. It was fascinating to watch the author dismantle each defense I didn't realize I was using. I'm also glad to have the new view of racism not as binary, but a continuum. The line, "I'm not a racist, so I don't need to read this, or work on anything" is simply invalid. There's always room for improvement.</p>
