<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Fredrik Backman</b></p>
<p>An enjoyable story. Of Fredrik Backman's books, I've only read this and "A Man Called Ove". Despite that, between these two books, it's obvious that he writes about quirky people really well - allowing them to be both quirky and endearingly human. Not only that, but Backman is able to paint a picture of a place I've never been, yet I can clearly see in my mind's eye. Although Britt-Marie isn't Ove, it's still worth your time... and your bicarbonate of soda.</p>
