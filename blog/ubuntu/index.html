<p>Without a real purpose or point to doing it, I loaded a new system onto my PC the other day. I've essentially come to the realization that I only need a text editor, and the internet (with a web browser (preferrably Firefox)), and I'm 80% happy on a computer. A decent image editing program would make me feel good too, but I can get by 80% of the time without one.</p>
<p>So, what on earth did I do this for? For the halibut of course. Why <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>? No real clue. Somebody was nice enough at one point to give me a POS laptop for school. The thing is really crappy, and totally pointless, since it can't get on the internet. I'd say that if I don't have the internet on a computer... only 30% happy with the computer. So, with this junky laptop, I installed <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/">SuSe</a> but it ran slower than all get out. It came on either 4 or 5 CD's and probably took 4 to 5 hours to install. The system was slow, and eventually... useless to me. So, I got Ubuntu, and gave it a shot.</p>
<p>They claim that with Linux (Ubuntu and SuSe are versions/kinds/flavors of Linux) that you can bring older computers back to life, and get new use out of them. SuSe wasn't happening for me on that laptop, hence Ubuntu (which works like a charm on the laptop and now also on my PC desktop).</p>
<p>Still unable to get on the internet, it's not all that great. It's the only one of my three computers to have a floppy disk drive. That's helpful... not. It's got some games. I can mess it up and not really care. It's a computer. Whatever.</p>
<p>I know nothing about Linux. I've already reinstalled 3 or 4 times (was missing a really simple step at the beginning), but only one of them was necessary for me. I'll probably reinstall it again when I mess something else up. All in all though, if I don't like it, I'll just reboot, and load Winblows the next time around. Now I just need to figure out how to turn this thing into a webserver, and we'll be talking more serious stuff...</p>
