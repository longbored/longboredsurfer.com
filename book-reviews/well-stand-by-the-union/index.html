<div class="content"><p>Born to privilege as the only son of fervent abolitionists, after a youth that could only be described as cultured, Rob Shaw felt the call of duty to serve his country in the Civil War. Reading about John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry (while on location), he warmed from being a tepid abolitionist and advocate of black soldiers serving in the Army. Not long after that he received the honor of serving as the leader of the 54th Massachusetts, which was among the first black units in the Civil War. This describes his upbringing, some of the recruiting efforts, training, and engagements of the unit.</p>
<p>It's a very quick read, and not as full of details as I would have wanted. I admire Shaw, his men, and their actions. I can't imagine it would have been easy either to serve, or serve in this capacity in a time like this. It was heart-warming to see his feelings change as he led his regiment, and came to love them. I could have enjoyed more about Shaw specifically, as well as more about the individual men in the regiment. Unfortunately, you're left with a scant overview of most people and events, which could be due to a lack of documentation during the time, or maybe just due to the author's attempt at brevity.</p>
<p>Typos and brevity aside, if you're looking for a very quick and focused view on this relatively small aspect of the war, look no further.</p></div>
