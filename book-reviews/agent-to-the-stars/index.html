<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>John Scalzi</b></p>
<p>I've read a handful of books by John Scalzi, and each time I have, I've enjoyed it. They're not elaborate, or super in-depth, but very entertaining and approachable science fiction. This one is no different than the others. In short, a middleground Hollywood agent ends up with an unusual client, and they try to navigate life and typical Hollywood drama. I have several moments of laughing out loud - which also feels like something I do in each of his books. I obviously need to see what else Scalzi has written.</p>
