<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Victoria E. Schwab</b></p>
<p>An easy fantasy series to start into. It's fast-moving, and I could use some more details, but that's also part of the enjoyment of the book. As the characters shift through a few forms of London, each has its own set of characteristics, and ways which magic works. This is easy fantasy to enjoy, and will surely bring me back for the two others in this series. There's some gory violence, but if you're a fantasy fan, this should be an easy one to pick up.</p>
