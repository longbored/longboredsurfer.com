<h1><a href="//20050726-invented-names/">Invented Names</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b></b></p>
<p>I'm not sure why people make up names. They invent them, as if there were a shortage of names. They put letters together in some fashion, and call it a name. Nobody has ever heard it before, but apparently the parents seem stuck on the name, not realizing the pain in the butt that name will be to the child later in life.</p>
<p>Now, I know I'm on thin ice here. Several people I know either have an invented name, have given an invented name to a child, are planning on doing it, or are in favor of them. Before I continue, let me remind those of you who might not agree with my opinion, that this is my web site, and you're welcome to leave at any time. The funky names in question haven't been a reason for me not to talk to you in the past, and if you choose to let them be your reason, get over it, come up with something you don't like, and submit it. I'd be happy to post similar stories.</p>
<p>Got a family tradition for how to name your child? Okay. Got an ancestor with the same name and you're naming a child in the same way? Whatever you say. Looking for a name for your child off of a state map? You've got issues. Thinking of random numbers and finding their position in the alphabet and calling it a name? That's just dumb. Coming up with an alternative spelling of a common name? I could think of a better use of time. Taking the names of non-human things and making them names for your children? Don't mind me if I nickname your child "losers-for-parents."</p>
<p>The point is... there are thousands upon thousands of names out there. I can understand that you want your child to be unique... but you don't want them TOO unique... those are the kids that get made fun of in school, wedgies every thursday after gym class, never able to find one of those personalized license plates that kids put on their bikes, constant spelling-of-the-name for everybody, since nobody understands what their name is. Can't you think of something better to do with your time than thinking of a way to torment your child for the rest of their life by way of a name?</p>
<p>\&lt;sigh&gt; Some people just don't get it.</p>
