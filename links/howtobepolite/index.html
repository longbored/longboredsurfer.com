<p>I'd prefer to title this "How to be Considerate", but even with its title as-is, it's worth reading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People silently struggle from all kinds of terrible things. They suffer from depression, ambition, substance abuse, and pretension. They suffer from family tragedy, Ivy-League educations, and self-loathing. They suffer from failing marriages, physical pain, and publishing. The good thing about politeness is that you can treat these people exactly the same.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>This is not a world where you can simply express love for other people, where you can praise them. Perhaps it should be. But itâ€™s not. Iâ€™ve found that people will fear your enthusiasm and warmth, and wait to hear the price. Which is fair. Weâ€™ve all been drawn into someoneâ€™s love only to find out that we couldnâ€™t afford it. A little distance buys everyone time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to list empathy as an effect of this "politeness". I'm not sure if it's a result of it, or a cause for it. We can all be a bit nicer. A bit more patient. A bit more understanding. A little slower to pass judgement. A bit more thoughtful. A bit more considerate.</p>
