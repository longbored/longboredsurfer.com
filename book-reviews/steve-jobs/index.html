<div class="content"><p>I took forever to read this book, but not because it was boring. I just kept getting distracted. Each time I'd read it, I enjoyed it. Despite how much I enjoyed it, I fear my opinion of the book is skewed by my Apple fanboy-ism. Long review short: I liked it, but I'm not sure how many other people really would. It's not a book I'd recommend to many people.</p>
<p>Although the book was interesting, there wasn't much that was very surprising. Steve Jobs was a blunt, passionate, optionally charismatic man with a vision. Although I don't see him as a highly quotable person, or a leader in thought, his drive and dedication helped to bring us products that have changed our lives. Or, at least my life.</p>
<p>When the book first came out I read some reviews by various people (generally in the Apple/Mac community). One of the complaints I read about the book was that it didn't dissect the magic of Steve Jobs. I'm not sure how many biographies that person had ever read, since that seemed unrealistic. When I read a biography, I'd like to learn about the person, their motivations, background, accomplishments, and get to know them better than I did before. That may be an incomplete list, but my point is that I feel it's unfair to expect a biography to be able to explain the gut instinct, or taste that Jobs had, or how exactly he was able to think different(ly).</p></div>
