<p>Though not as enjoyable as the first book in the series (most likely because this seemed to present fewer new concepts than the prior), it's still an entertaining book, continued in the same fascinating world(s). Taking place entirely on Equatoria, this book follows Turk Findley and Lise Adams, as Lise tries to piece together her father's disappearance. Interacting with people involved in illegal, life-extending pharmaceuticals, they learn about both their past, and the future. Having another world linked to ours via a gigantic portal is... a weird concept, but apart from these things, it's a simple story about people trying to find their way. Not bad.</p>
