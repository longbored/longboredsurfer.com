<p>I've had this tab open for several months. I keep going back to a concept V.E. Schwab shares here - that there are multiple doors by which someone may enter into... anything, really. That could be fandom, or expertise, or anything else. We as people that are already in whatever group it may be, we should welcome newcomers, regardless of their path (or entry door). This is well worth the read.</p>
