<p>I love custom-made cards - birthdays, holidays, whatever. I think they have a bit more style and awesomeness in them. In this particular case, each of the members of this design team have created their own. Although each card is different, they carry a similar-ish theme (and color palette). I feel like I should start working now on my card for this year.</p>
