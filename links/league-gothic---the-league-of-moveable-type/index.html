<p>While I'm on typefaces, The League of Moveable Type was good enough to notice that Morris Fuller Benton's classic Alternate Gothic No. 1 is in the public domain, and they made their own version, which I really like. I admit, I've been enjoying Gothic-style typefaces lately. I just might like this one more than <a href="/links/public-gothic-antrepo4com/">Public Gothic</a>, which I found the other day.</p>
