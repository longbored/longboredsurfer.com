<p>Some day I'd like to buy a 3D Printer. I can't yet tell myself I'd use it enough to justify the cost, but I think it'd be fun. Yes I'm a nerd, but you're still reading this. Monument Valley is a great game. I <em>really</em> like the totem from it. Having something like this would be cool. The full combined archive is available on Thingiverse, but for whatever reason wouldn't attach to this post. I've split the full archive into two - one for the totem, and one for Ida (and both with the CC attribution files). Enjoy!</p>
