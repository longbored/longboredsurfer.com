<p>Out of curiosity, I started this book, hoping the author would make a change with his graphic ways. He didn't, and I should have stopped. By this point, I feel like I have the author figured out in how he chooses to tell (at least these) stories - MAJOR PLOT TWIST followed by mundane story telling, demonstrating how the characters are <em>way</em> ahead of you, and totally saw that major plot twist coming. Rinse and repeat.</p>
