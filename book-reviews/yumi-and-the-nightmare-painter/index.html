<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this book would work just fine if you're unfamiliar with other books by the author, Brandon Sanderson. In this book, the two main characters are seemingly in totally different worlds/environments, inexplicably tied together, and trying to make sense of their connection and their lives and realities. At the end of the day, the book is about relationships, both interpersonal, and intrapersonal. It's impressive that Sanderson is able to quickly build a world and characters I could enjoy, relate to, and cheer for.</p>
