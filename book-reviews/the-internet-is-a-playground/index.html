<div class="content"><p>A collection of things meant to be comical, and sometimes succeeding. He has some pretend scenarios that he's written about, and people that he's written about, and those were more often than not, not funny. Why rate a book with any stars, if it's supposed to be funny, and it isn't? Because the rest of the book was made up of email conversations, where he shows his real comedic ability. It was astounding how varied, and humorous his responses were. It's been a while since I've laughed out loud (at a book) as I did with this book. When it's good, it's great. When it's not, it's <em>really</em> bad.</p></div>
