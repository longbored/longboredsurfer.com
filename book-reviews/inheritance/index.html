<p>I enjoyed the story, and find each of the books easy to digest. They're <strong>far</strong> from heavy reading, so they're on the simple side of fantasy, in my view. I felt the ending of the book dragged a bit, but I appreciate the way this book ties off the series as a whole. If you've read the series up to this point, you certainly need to read this one.  </p>
<p>As a note on the audio books, I love the reader on these books (though the dragon voices are a bit weird). His accent and pacing are perfect.</p>
