<div class="content"><p>I haven't enjoyed a book as much as this one in quite a while. You should read it. Seriously.  </p>
<hr />
<p>(Added with my 3/7/2018 reread:)<br />
I haven't tracked how many times I've reread or re-listened to this book. Regardless, it has become relaxing to me, and familiar like a good pair of shoes. I revisited this book, as my oldest is reading it for the first time. I enjoy the foreshadowing, which wasn't as obvious the first times(s) through the book, but far more obvious with repeat visits. I still wonder how much of it plays into the yet-to-be-released third book. As it is, I continue to really enjoy this book, but also continue to wish the introduction didn't have such a slow pickup for first-time readers. Despite that slowness, the book makes for a great reread.</p></div>
