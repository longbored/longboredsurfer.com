<p>My as-spoiler-free-as-possible synopsis: Cryogenically frozen Bob is reanimated many years later, and is key in galaxy exploration and expanding the human race. This book was far more entertaining and humorous than this awful (though accurate) description would indicate.  </p>
<p>Bob is an entertaining character, and in such a hypothetical setting, it's on full display. This is a quick book, and I'm likely to pick up the second book in the series at some point. Seems like a no-brainer for somebody remotely interested in sci-fi, maker-related humorous fiction, or hypothetical space exploration.</p>
