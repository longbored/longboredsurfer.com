<p>Although this book came highly recommended, I was left wanting more development, or maybe just a not-so-rushed conclusion. Maybe if I actually cared about NYC, then I might have more of a connection to the book.  </p>
<p>More of a science-fiction novel, the reader is told intentionally disjointed stories about the private detective Rad, and the street thug Rex. Taking place in a prohibition-era NYC-style city, the reader is left to join together the story, and figure out Rad's latest case, and why Rex can't figure out where he is.</p>
