	<p>I'm going to be talking about the toilet, and possibly the potential contents of that device. If you're less than interested in reading about this, so be it, feel free to leave now. But don't get half-way through this thing and then start blaming me that I didn't warn you. I mean, you had to know that it was coming, since how many other things have to do with Flushing?</p>
<p>We're not talking about the <a href="http://www.flushingcity.com/">Michigan</a> city, nor the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_New_York">section</a> of the borough of Queens. (And was it that both places were started shortly after a bad case of food poisoning or Montezuma's revenge?) We're talking about the act of initiating the flow of water in the receptacle used for the disposal of human waste.</p>
<p>A toilet has a special balance of fluids. By introducing a mass of fluid to the front end, as long as the waterways are cleared, the flow continues off into never-never-land, probably to join little Nemo. The key is the introduction of a new mass of fluid (what's in the tank behind where you're sitting), and the cleared waterway. (You can read more about toilets magical workings <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/toilet.htm/printable">here</a>)</p>
<p>You want to stand there by an empty toilet and repeatedly flush it? Go for it tiger. Flush it all day long for all I care - don't send me the bill for the water though.</p>
<p>If you use the services and they become clogged after the first flush, it is a general practice to use a plunger to free the waterways. The thing I wish to address is the act of flushing a second time, prior to those waterways being cleared.</p>
<p>If the thing is clogged, and you flush it again, a tank-full of water is trying to go somewhere lower than its current position... which is on the floor. It doesn't just go directly to the floor, it makes a quick visit with one of its friends (your waste) and then brings it along for a little trip downward. It's gross, there's no bones about it.</p>
<p>Don't flush a second time, unless you're satisfied with where the water will go. Sure, it's possible for the a second flush to happen while the toilet is clogged. Sometimes there is a slow leak that happens. The waterways aren't 100% cleared, but they're cleared enough for a little water to get by. The water level might lower bit by bit, and get back to a reasonable level.</p>
<p>If the water in the toilet is at about the same level it was before you got the party started, feel free to flush. For the most part, the water in the tank will almost perfectly fill the bowl. It also is kind enough to leave room for the plunger, and the air that is contained therein.</p>
<p>Since plunging is such a great activity, let me tell you of some of my previous thoughts while plunging:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm having a horrible day</li>
<li>I'll eat all my vegetables tonight if this doesn't overflow</li>
<li>All I did was pee... so why do I have to unclog this?</li>
<li>I hope this doesn't take long, I need to leave</li>
<li>That thing was masterful</li>
<li>Is that the phone? Go, go, go, go, go...</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do I bring this up? I witnessed something that was fairly humorous, which turned into a messy situation and wish to remind those of you out there who are tempted to push down on that little lever once more. So many people think that a second flush is the answer to your clogged problem, when really it's just going to make the floor really stinky.</p>
