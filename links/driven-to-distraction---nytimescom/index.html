<p>Utah now penalizes a texting driver who causes a fatality as harshly as a drunken driver who kills someone. Since I live in the state and know some people who lost their son (who was on his way home from his son's soccer game, sitting at a stoplight and got rear-ended) to a teenager who was texting and driving, I find this especially applicable. Full-blown negligence.</p>
