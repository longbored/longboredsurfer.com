<p>Included at the end of Lock In, in some ways this feels like the author wanted to include a lot more background of the disease than he originally could in his book. Instead of doing that, he opted to cut what was included in the book WAY down, and then expand this into a fictional science journal article. Much more (only?) enjoyable if you've read Lock In.</p>
