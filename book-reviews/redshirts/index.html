<p>4.5 stars? This book took me on a ride, since I not only had no clue what to expect, but it also didn't end how I thought it would. Twice. Half a star off being so short... though I don't think making it any longer would make it any better. Another half off for zero percent re-readability. I don't generally call myself a sci-fi fan, but I sure enjoyed this one.</p>
