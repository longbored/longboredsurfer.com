<p>The other day I was speaking with somebody and they pronounced "speedometer" like "SPEED-oh-mee-ter" as opposed to "sped-AWE-meh-ter". I thought to myself and commented afterwards, "If that's what that's called, wouldn't it be measuring speedos instead of... speed?" For the record, I'd like to provide you a list of things that I'd personally like to <strong>not</strong>have to deal with on a daily basis, let alone measure (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Speedos</li>
<li>Zombies</li>
<li>Eraser burns</li>
<li>Fecal samples</li>
<li>Water Chestnuts</li>
</ul>
<p>I think things pretty much speak for themselves in that list. :)</p>
