<p>I've read (or listened to) lots of spy novels, but the enjoyable detail of this book, was that it was non-fiction. The ending of the story is obvious, since it's part of the title of the book, but how they get there is interesting. Although I wish there were more details about the actual extraction, I really liked all of the side stories told by Mendez.</p>
