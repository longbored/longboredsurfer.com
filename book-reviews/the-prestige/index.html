<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Christopher Priest</b></p>
<p>I'm sure I would have enjoyed this book more having read it prior to seeing the movie. It carries a similar story line, yet presented in a very different fashion/order. I feel the book could seriously have gone without one of the story lines. I was intrigued by the writing style of the author and would be curious to read another of his books, despite my lack-luster review of this book.</p>
