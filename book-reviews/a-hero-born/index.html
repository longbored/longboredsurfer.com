<p>I wanted to enjoy this story more than I did. I admit I found myself being confused by the various names of characters. Combine that with the jumping around in time to tell various parts of the collective story, and more often than not I felt like I was simply trying to figure out who am I supposed to recognize from earlier in the book is now doing what in the current scene. I'm comfortable this would be better on a second time through, but it likely won't get that courtesy from me any time soon.</p>
