<p>I read this on recommendation from a friend, and I'm glad I did. The points are clearly laid out, and obviously <em>extremely</em> well thought-through. More than one of the "rules" of life are, for me, life-changing - a true shift in my paradigm. They were well-timed in my life, so even more poignant. The only downside to the book, I thought, was just how well organized the rules were. Each of them were laid out in such a way that if you somehow didn't follow the author's train of thought, there may be a chance you wouldn't be able to get back on that proverbial train. That happened to me more than once. Unfortunately, there was one point I never could fully grasp. Heavy stuff. Worth it.</p>
