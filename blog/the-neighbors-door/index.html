<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b></b></p>
<p>My upstairs neighbors who are fairly noisy (really they just seem to stomp around a lot, especially their kids as they go up and down the stairs) are out of town, so it generally means it's quieter. They left a door open on their patio and the wind keeps hitting it against the railing. It makes a pretty healthy gong sound at pretty much any hour. I think I might be mentally ill if I say this... but I think I'd rather have the neighbors than their door.</p>
