<p>I was loading groceries into the car the other day and a pair of butt cheeks caught my eye. While his mother was on her cell phone, this little kid had gotten out of the car, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drop+trou">dropped trou</a>, and proceeded to urinate on the rear-left tire of his own car. He finished quickly, pulled back up his pants, got back in the car... and his mom was still on her cell phone. I'm glad the kid did that and not me. More interested in her conversation than her son... ~~she~~ her car deserves to get peed on.</p>
