<p>At least that's when Maria would like it to be (and probably at least three other times during the year), especially for Cecilia and Becky. I kid you not, moments ago she told me she had built a shopping list at a web site for me to look over. “What for?” “For Christmas.” Yeah... it's April. Can't wait for the next eight months to go by so we can get to that.</p>
