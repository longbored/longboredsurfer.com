	<p>I understand that we as a nation are overweight. I know they've made movies about it that can make you sick as you watch. The Atkins craze was enough to make me want to hit somebody. The Special K diet is out there and available to all you cereal junkies (a serving size has never looked so small... let me assure you). <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286244/">The Triplets of Bellville</a> portray all Americans as walking balloons - and not the kind used to make poodles and swords (it's a great movie, by the way).</p>
<p>Hewlett Packard, in case they didn't have <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/05/technology/hp/">enough</a> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/BUSINESS/09/08/hp.reporters.reut/">to</a> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/BUSINESS/09/12/hp.dunn.ap/">worry about</a>, has now endorsed obesity in our culture by adding a <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/consumer/digital_photography/tours/slimming/index_f.html">slimming effect</a> to digital cameras, so you can just click a couple buttons, and the camera will automatically adjust the photos to make the people in your photos skinnier. Although I can agree that it would behoove quite a few of us (me included) to lose a pound or two, endorsing doctored photos to make people feel less self-conscious about their weight is ridiculous. Afterall, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/30/tv.couric.alteredphoto.ap/">Katie Couric did it</a>, why can't we?</p>
