<p>This was a book club selection, and it's another reminder of why I enjoy this book club. If left to my own, it's a book I probably wouldn't have chosen to read. That said, I'm glad I did. Whether you want to call this book a personal history, or a history of Nike, it's still interesting. It's somewhat inspirational, in terms of suggesting that you follow your purpose relentlessly. Now, to take a trip around the world, experience foreign cultures, study some of the world's great generals, and be incredibly lucky while doing so...  </p>
<p>Thayne, good choice.</p>
