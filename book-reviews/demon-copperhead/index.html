<p>This book got pretty dark. Twice. I read this for a book club, and I'll be interested to hear the discussion. While fictional, the opioid epidemic never felt more real. I don't enjoy reading books like this (1 of 5 stars), so I don't anticipate passing along this suggestion to anybody. That said, it was really well-written, and highly engaging (5 of 5 stars).</p>
