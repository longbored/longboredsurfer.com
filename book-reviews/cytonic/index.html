<h2>To continue the theme of the second book, this book yet again is a large departure from where the first or second book is. Despite that, I enjoyed the more adventuring sides of this book. Spensa (the protagonist) is an enjoyable character, and more/better time is taken to build the others in this book as well. Relatable trials, despite them being so foreign. I'm very interested to see where the series ends up. Similar to books 1 and 2, I know I can hand this series to the YA readers in my home, and know they'll be in for a good story that won't have me cringe. Also, you should start this series at the beginning.</h2>
<p>Now on my second time through this book, I think my first review was pretty spot on. Not only that, but I think reading the novellas has become much more important to enjoying the series as a whole.</p>
