<p class="meta">Published on 2006-12-30 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>We've all seen those guys on TV parade around with big 'ol posters of somebody's face on them. There seem to be quite a few people that own those posters. I'm not entirely familiar with their cause, or the purpose of the parading, but I have to ask... where do they get those posters? Kinkos? The local religious zealot material distribution center? I've been to some of those centers, and I'll admit I didn't see any of those things. Do you have to special order them? Do they keep them in the back? Do I have to give some sort of code word to get to see them? Is there a catalog of them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ohhh, I see you've got one of the Groundskeeper from Caddy Shack! Uh... could I get that in a sepia tone? Oh yeah, and toss in an order of fries and a Diet Coke while you're at it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it considered shameful not to have one of them? Not only do I not own an oversized poster with the likeness of my preferred religious leader on it, I don't personally know anybody who does. Would my lack of ownership make me exempt from one of those rally things? How about from gaggles, or shindigs, or gatherings? How about from parades? Am I not allowed to act like I'm watching The Rose Parade this coming Monday, just because I don't own one? Maybe I can find some poster-board, and a magic marker and go for it. I hope nobody minds if my hand-drawn picture looks like something from Calvin and Hobbes. It's either that, or you can speed up the delivery of my poster, and toss in one of my favorite motivational speaker, Matt Foley.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, who would you choose to have on your poster(s), and why? (no serious responses permitted)</p>
