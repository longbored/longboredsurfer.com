<p>For Christmas I got socks. That's no problem with me, since I asked for them. The problem is that they're cheap socks. Yes, I'm saying that out loud (not just typed on a blog). The problem with cheap socks is that they bunch up in your shoe. It really bugs when they get all bunched up in between your toes and the main part of your foot (or even at the end of your foot, like when the whole sock moves down your foot). You take your shoe off, straighten your sock out, and put your foot back in there. No more than 15 minutes later (less if you're actually walking), your sock is all bunched-up down there again. Grr. I'm buying myself better socks.</p>
