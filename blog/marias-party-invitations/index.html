<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b></b></p>
<p>A while back I created an invitation for Maria's birthday party. Inspired by a birthday card created by the incredibly talented <a href="http://benschlitter.com">Ben Schlitter</a>, I wanted to add a personal touch to the invitations. I wanted something beyond the usual hand-lettering which let people know an invitation was hand-made, but didn't want it to look too amateurish. Granted, this invitation was technically computer-made, but you know what I mean. With a Mexican theme to the party, I went to work.</p>
<p>Here's the (slightly modified) finished invitation:<img alt="Maria's Invitation" src="invitation.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Invitation Color Swatches" src="invitation_color_swatches.png" /><a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Kuler</a> came to the rescue again with the color theme. I picked out two <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/492349">alternate</a> <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/487433">schemes</a>, but <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/511445">chose one</a> I felt was more workable considering the elements of the card. I made some adjustments to work in some of the more subtle elements. Of the three listed here, the middle option was my final choice (called “Aloha” by the creator).</p>
<p>The rest of the details to this work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk">Chunk</a> was the winning typeface again. I promise not to use it for my next piece, but it was just what I needed.</li>
<li>I got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calebkimbrough/3630759210/in/set-72157619796417566/">the texture</a> from one of <a href="http://www.bittbox.com/all/free-texture-tuesday-extreme-grunge/">BittBox's Free Texture Tuesday</a> postings. It gave a weathered feel to the piece, without ruining some of the detail I needed. I wanted it to play heavier in certain parts than in others (it was vital to have the party details clear, but the background, or candle could be as beat-up as anything).</li>
<li>I ended up double-layering the type behind and in front of the texture. I put them all behind the texture, then put a copy of the same type in front, and adjusted their opacity so some of the texture would come through, yet not be dominating.</li>
<li>The background pattern is from... <a href="http://www.bgpatterns.com/">BGPatterns.com</a>. Who would have thought you could get something like a background pattern from that site. Go figure. I wanted <a href="http://www.bgpatterns.com/icos/scrolls/swfs/20.swf">the unaltered version</a> of a pattern, and as large as possible so I could use it in print (as opposed to the web, which doesn't require such high fidelity).</li>
<li>I drew the candle. I don't think it's anything special, but I didn't need it to be. It communicated the nature of the party (or the vigil) very easily.</li>
<li>I printed the invitations on some decent card stock (ideally they would have been <em>super</em>-heavy stock, but I couldn't justify the cost), and bundled them with an equally-heavy piece of brown <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=kraft+paper&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g10&amp;start=0">kraft paper</a>, in an envelope of the same material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a mariachi band, piñata, pin the tail on the donkey, trivia, <a href="http://www.elpolloloco.com/">tasty food</a> (and super-simple catering), people we love, and the guest of honor... and it was a party to remember.</p>
