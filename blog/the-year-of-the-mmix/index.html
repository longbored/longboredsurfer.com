<h1><a href="/blog/20090505-the-year-of-the-mmix">The Year of the MMix</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2009-05-05 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/Year_of_the_Mix.gif" /><strong>You need to make a mix.</strong> It's that simple. I've wasted four whole months of one of the best years for the next thousand years. While looking at the artwork for (one of my <a href="/links/2009/04/#002089">recently linked-to items</a>) Ben Folds Presents: University a Cappaella! I noticed the roman numerals for 2009 are MMIX. It struck me... The Year of the MMix. Your elementary school brain may have suppressed roman numerals along with other bad memories, but this isn't the year to let that get you down. I just can't let this year go by (nor the mention of school) – I'm giving you homework.</p>
<p>When's the last time you made a mix? <strong>Seriously</strong>. I'm not talking about firing up iTunes and letting it make you a playlist via iTunes DJ or Genius. I'm talking about a heartfelt “This song actually means something to me/us or I want to share it.” type of mix. Whenever it was, it's time to make another one. Honestly now. Don't think I'm just bringing this up once. I'll be harping on this for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>You're 20-something? 30-something? 40-something? 50-something? 60-something? I don't care. It's time. It's time to take advantage of the MMix year. Find a theme, start picking out songs, keep it to CD-length, burn a disc, print a track list, and for extra credit, give it to somebody. Here are some ideas for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/soundtrack-of-your-life">The Soundtrack of Your Life</a> – Very few of you were actually reading my site over four years ago when I posted this. I can't give a higher recommendation for a musical activity than this one. It really is very cool to make.</li>
<li>G2 mixes – More of you may have read my exhaustive documentation about these mixes which I continue to make for Maria. You probably shouldn't make a mix for her, but you could make one for somebody else in your life. I could almost guarantee you they would appreciate it.</li>
<li>Other themes – I just started making another mix just last week (right before this revelation hit me). I'm aiming for more low-key songs—one might even say <em>chill-out</em> music. It's gonna be slick.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could do any of these (or all of these), or something totally different. The point here is to <strong>make a mix this year</strong>. I'd LOVE to hear back from you on this. Post a comment here. Put the track list here if you don't want to post it somewhere else. Get your friends to make a mix this year.</p>
<p>Making mixes isn't just for teenagers and bloggers still in love with their spouse.</p>
