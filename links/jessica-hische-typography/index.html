<p>Brilliant work by an illustrator/designer that is completely new to me - Jessica Hische. I <strong>love</strong> her work, especially her hand-lettering, which is her self-proclaimed specialty. I can clearly see why. What a fabulous find for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm such a space cadet, that I forgot I've <a href="/links/jessica-hische---alphabet-letterpress/">already linked to her</a>. At least the other was on her blog (which isn't super-obviously linked to from her portfolio). I'm also glad that I'm consistent in my linkage - previously it was her typography that grabbed me, and it still is.</p>
