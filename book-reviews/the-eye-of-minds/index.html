<p>This came on a recommendation from Brandon Sanderson, and honestly I could have skipped it. Maybe it's a genre that isn't really for me. I kept thinking of "Ready Player One" as I read this.  </p>
<p>The book takes place in a dystopian America, where once again society is hooked to a virtual world. Michael, the main character, strives to solve a mystery, and become an ultimate gamer.</p>
