	<h1><a href="/blog/20070702-5-things-listmania">5 Things - Listmania</a></h1>
	<p class="meta">Published on 2007-07-02 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
	<p>I was (not super officially) tagged by <a href="http://gilliatts.blogspot.com/2007/07/i-saw-this-on-dedes-blog-and-though-she.html">Shelby</a> to do the latest list thing. I'm happy to oblige, since I've never truly been tagged for one of these things but have been secretly wanting to do one. I modified the list back to the original requirement of 5 items and added the question she chose to exclude (plus added a new one of my own creation). Nothing here is listed in any particular order.</p>
<p><strong>What was I doing 10 years ago?</strong>
* Working as a fix-it guy at a hotel, cracking up at one of the workers colorful description of his disgust with Mike Tyson's ear-biting escapade against Evander Holyfield.</p>
<p><strong>What was I doing one year ago?</strong>
* Unhappily working at a company for a temporary manager I loved, looking to purchase a home out in the middle of nowhere (which we never did, and I think we're happy we didn't buy one there, since I changed jobs and would have horrendously impacted my commute), and getting excited for a trip to Newport Beach then another to Kauai.</p>
<p><strong>Five snacks I enjoy:</strong>
1. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
2. Mother's Animal Cookies (the pink and white ones—you know you love 'em too
3. A sliced cucumber with lemon juice and salt, preferably in a plastic bag (it's been a while, but it's <em>super</em> tasty
4. Cheez-it's... I'm liking the Hot \&amp; Spicy ones right now
5. Diet Coke – I feel like a total hypocrite, considering how I previously felt about this drink ("What a waste!!). I'm sorry Diet Coke. Please forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>Five things I would do if I were a millionaire (and not just barely, but disgustingly):</strong>
1. Quit my current job – Don't get me wrong. I really like my current job, but I can think of better things to do with my time.
2. Buy a house. Renting is only so much fun, and Maria would love to own a home.
3. Take my girls on another vacation, preferably to Europe.
4. Buy a new computer. It always seems like I could use a new one/two/three of those.
5. Share the wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Five of my many bad habits:</strong>
1. I pop my joints/knuckles - fingers, knees, back, neck, ankles, feet, toes, wrists - if I can figure out how to pop it, I'll keep doing it (my latest addition was the wrists, my right one more than the left)
2. I hardly ever wash my car - once a year is my average
3. I have crappy patience, as if this blog weren't evidence of that.
4. I don't like to tell people “no”. The overcommitment makes other areas suffer. :(
5. I pick and drive. You do it too, I've seen so many of you out there. You think nobody is looking, but you also know that's not true.</p>
<p><strong>Five things I like doing:</strong>
1. Spending time with my girls—Holding Becky, playing with Cecilia, doing most anything with Maria.
2. Goofing around on the computer – I probably do this too much as-is, but I like it.
3. Being around family. Not too much at once though, I get worn out.
4. Reading books (or even listening to them). Again, another amazing full circle thing here. Lots of wasted time earlier in my life for books I wasn't reading.
5. Cooking, then enjoying the end results... just don't make me do the dishes</p>
<p><strong>Five things I will never wear again:</strong>
1. A speedo – sorry ladies, I just don't see it happening
2. More than one pair of shoe laces per shoe... especially not different colored ones
3. My Hostess Ding Dong shirt – I gave it to Cecilia as a night shirt, plus it doesn't fit me anymore.
4. Lakers paraphernalia. Despite my father's actions to raise me otherwise, I'm a member of the holy faith of the Spurs. Go Spurs!
5. My lunch — here's to hoping for being sure-footed and/or having the intestinal fortitude to keep myself clean</p>
<p><strong>Five of my favorite toys:</strong>
1. Our Camera (Nikon D50) - it takes great photos and really helps capture the moment
2. Nintendo Wii - holy crap, this thing is awesome
3. My MacBook - it's not the nicest Mac out there, but once you go Mac, you never go back
4. iPod - not the newest, but highly addictive. Once I got my first one (4 gig, 1st generation clunker) I knew I was a lost cause</p>
<p><strong>Five songs to which I know all the words:</strong>
1. Cake - Alpha Beta Parking Lot – Always been a Cake fan. You might remember that they even made it on <a href="/blog/skip-to-my-lou-and-contest">my soundtrack</a>.
2. The Beatles - Blackbird – One of the very <em>very</em> few songs I can semi-play on the guitar. (I also like Sarah McLachlan's rendition from I Am Sam)
3. Nicho Hinojosa - Asi Son Ellas – great lyrics... it sometimes helps to speak Spanish.
4. Jack Johnson - Banana Pancakes – Fitting for this list, since Shelby was the first to introduce me to Jack
5. Alison Krauss \&amp; Union Station - Restless – I can't seem to get enough of these guys (and girl)</p>
<p><strong>Five things I'd like for my next birthday: (only a couple weeks away!)</strong>
1. (Book) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/159059844X">Michael Lopp - Managing Humans</a>
2. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple iPhone</a> - I admit it, finally... I want one.
3. A College Degree – I'm <em>so</em> close. Just a little more.
4. (Book) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifetime-Secrets-PostSecret-Book/dp/0061238600">A Lifetime of Secrets: A PostSecret Book</a>
5. (T-Shirt) <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/850/Refrigerator_Running">Refrigerator Running</a> – too bad it's sold out.</p>
<p><strong>Five people who are officially challenged to do this same thing in their own way:</strong> (though 3 of them are fairly/highly unlikely to actually respond to me). If you <strong>do</strong> respond, let me know and I'll update the links here to those posts.
1. <a href="http://clifton.im">Clifton</a>
2. <a href="http://talesofstrude.blogspot.com">Strude</a>
3. <a href="http://www.kissyourshadow.com">Caitlin</a>
4. <a href="http://ken-jennings.com/blog/">Ken Jennings</a>
5. <a href="http://www.apple.com">Steve Jobs</a></p>
