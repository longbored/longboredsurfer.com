<div class="content"><p>An enjoyable story of an otherwise peaceful group of mice, being threatened by a scurge - both in reality and name, and their attempt to deter that scurge, and unite. I enjoyed the various story lines, the world the author built, and the general anthropomorphism of the variety of forest animals. The version of this that I listened to was done by a cast of people, which was quite fun.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I had somebody tell me this was their favorite book series as a youth. This has consequently been sitting on my back burner for all of these years. Although I don't anticipate reading all 22 books, I can see how this cleverly built world would be highly engaging and entertaining - especially to the younger/target audience.</p></div>
