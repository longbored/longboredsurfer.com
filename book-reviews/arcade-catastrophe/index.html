<div class="content"><p>My daughter and I are both listening to these books together. I think the idea of having special powers granted temporarily, is fun. Although there were new elements to this book, this was essentially a rinse-and-repeat of the first book. The concepts are fun (especially for kids) but some of the lessons are lame/horrendous: "If somebody (especially a total stranger, with suspicious or unknown motives) gives you moments to make a decision between pursuing something mysterious and potentially cool, vs holding to your values and not disregarding your family, you should _definitely_ check out that mysterious thing. Every. single. time. And if you discover that in order to keep whatever that cool thing is, you have to do something illegal or questionable, you should TOTALLY just go for it. I mean, who cares? Amiright? YOLO!" Plus, the timing of events in both of these books is WAY too convenient.</p></div>
