<p>If you're ever curious on how to make Yahoo stop referring people to your website... all you have to do is put some ads on your site from Google. I signed up for Google Ads, and within 2 days, my traffic from Yahoo went from about 40 hits a day down to 0. Whoa.... their search bot must be a little sensitive to that sort of thing. Note to self: if you put ads on your site from Google, at least program the page not to display the things if they're referred from Yahoo. Since I'm not that smart, I just took the ads off. Nobody was clicking them anyway.</p>
<p>Too bad Yahoo doesn't seem to want to advertise on my site. Go figure. "We don't want them to do it, but we don't want to either." Seems like a double standard, but whatever.</p>
