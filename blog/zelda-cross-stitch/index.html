<p>Last night I finished cross stitching this. I didn't measure, but I think it took me around five hours. Why did I all of a sudden decide to cross stitch something? Part of it had to do with my mother cross stitching when I was young, and another part probably had to do with my daughter getting a small sewing kit for Christmas. In that kit was a cross stitch sampler, and that curiosity of cross-stitching was re-ignited. I didn't want to make a Precious Moments cross stitch, so I went to a theme I could enjoy - Zelda. I'll spare you too many details, but I can at least leave you with these few resources if you want to maybe give it a shot yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://spritestitch.com">SpriteStitch.com</a> - A respectable source for various patterns. What's even better is that people will happily convert images to patterns for you.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spritestitch.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=3509">Here</a> is the pattern I used. Obviously I didn't use each of the pieces. I just wanted Link hoisting the Triforce.</li>
<li>If you want some pattern they don't offer, look for some video game sprites, put something together in Paint, and ask nicely for somebody to make it for you.</li>
<li>Spend some time on YouTube watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cross%20stitch&amp;sm=3">how to cross stitch</a>. There are lots of videos, and it's pretty easy to get going.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm already debating what my next project might be. I doubt this will become my new passion, but it's a good way to unwind, and have something to show for your time.</p>
