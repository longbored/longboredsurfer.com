<p>I really liked this book. I thoroughly enjoyed how the author would intertwine her own experiences, along with those of others, as well as elements of psychology. Having sought the assistance of mental health experts in the past, I appreciated how she pushed to destigmatize the role those experts should play in our lives at times. I'd give it an extra half star if I could.</p>
