<p>I thought this book was the best of the series thus far. I'm not sure how I felt about the portions of the book that were narrated by Jacob. I think it just showed that the author understands females better than males, but this quibble is irrelevant to the book as a whole. A quick read, and enough pieces to the plot to keep me interested throughout.</p>
