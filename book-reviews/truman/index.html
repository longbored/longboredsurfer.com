<div class="content"><p>Quite simply put - this is my new favorite non-fiction (non-religious) book I've ever read. I admit it - David McCullough could write about nearly anything, and I'd probably be captivated by what he has to share. That being said, Truman himself was such a remarkable person that the material practically wrote itself. What an incredible person, and what a statement he makes. I repeatedly called my father (a big fan of the book) to say, "I mean - holy cow! What an incredible person." I completely agree with my father's review - Truman truly represents what we all admire in this, "The Greatest Generation". I enjoyed learning about such pivotal points in our nation's history, finding out about the various ways that Truman impacted many of those point, and most pivotal to this book, the truly incredible character of Harry S Truman. If we had more people like him leading our nation, or us as a people, we'd all be better for it.</p></div>
