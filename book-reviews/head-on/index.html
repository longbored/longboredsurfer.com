<h1><a href="//20200306-head-on/">Head On</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>John Scalzi</b></p>
<p>A whirlwind FBI investigation following a series of event that seem too much of a coincidence.  </p>
<p>I by far preferred the first book, but I sure enjoy the world the author has built. Near-future sci-fi, with people able to experience the world and control remote robotic bodies to continue living a normal life. Although the author is focused on crime investigations in a world like this, it has potential to be a lot of other things. Through the book he hints at things that would be commonplace in such a world, and those details are enjoyable.</p>
