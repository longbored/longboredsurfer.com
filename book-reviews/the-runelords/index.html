<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>David Farland</b></p>
<p>This book/series has an interesting dynamic where people are able to give one endowment of a specific trait (looks, hearing, vision, wit, braun, metabolism, etc) to somebody else, completely losing that trait themselves. With a tyrant able to collect thousands of endowments from others, the northern kingdoms are looking to bond together against a seemingly unstoppable force.  </p>
<p>The most notable thing about this book, apart from the magic system mentioned, is that the book simply... ended. Just like that. It felt _very_ anticlimactic, or that it was stopping at a point that wasn't really the end. I'm curious to read another in the series, but I'm not sure when I'll make it a priority.</p>
