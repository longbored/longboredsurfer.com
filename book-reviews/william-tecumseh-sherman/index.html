	<div class="content"><p>One can't help but make comparisons between William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant. The author does so repeatedly, and seems to feel Sherman is superior to Grant in numerous prominent ways. While I disagree, I'm glad to know Sherman better by way of this biography. However, I don't see myself pursuing any additional books about him. As a book, apart from this bias of the author, the book was well-written, and laid out. The pacing was as could be expected when the subject had relatively few accomplishments after the Civil War. Cump's fascination with California makes me chuckle, as do some of his curmudgeonly ways.</p>
<p>While Uncle Willie was undoubtedly a great leader and general during a time of great need for the country, he had some characteristics I struggle with, and furthermore seems a bit hard to like. He had a pro-to-middle-of-the-road sentiment about slavery (which thankfully evolved into being anti-slavery), and while he was cordial and congenial with people who weren't white he was a devout believer of their inferiority. While raised and surrounded by devoutly religious people, Sherman's nearly anti-religious stance wasn't fully explored - which may have been due to lack of openness by Sherman himself. Of interest, I was somewhat saddened for Sherman at how unsupportive his wife Ellen seemed to be. Obviously there are two sides to every story, but if she really was the way described, I can only imagine how trying that may have been at times.</p>
<p>As a General in the Army, he'll continue to be known for his march to Atlanta, Savannah, and through the Carolinas. Grant's overall vision of how to defeat the south was great, and Sherman brought that vision to fruition. I love reading about the defeat of the Southern armies every time. What a mistaken cause it all was. Sherman's execution and pointed retribution was great.</p>
<p>That said, he'll also continue to be known for his blunt view on war - that it's "hell", as well as "a terrible thing", and "cruelty, and you cannot refine it." While I enjoy reading about wars, I still know I cannot truly fathom how terrible they are.</p>
<p>Lastly, I know Sherman was a favorite of my grandfather's. And while I see a number of similarities between those two men, among the many other topics I'd love to cover with him, I'd love to have my grandfather back to discuss his interest in this particular man. May they both rest in peace.</p></div>
