<p>While I don't agree with all the points of the book, I can't argue with how well the points were presented, nor the various examples as they supported those points. This made an interesting book club book, as some people were completely against the book, where I found the points and premise to be well made. In some of the continuously fracturing elements of society, I felt this book represented some of the concerns others have expressed, but in a much more educated and informed manner.</p>
