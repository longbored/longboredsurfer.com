<p>I've been asked to remove the recipes I previously had on my site, and I'm happy to comply. The recipes have not lost their quality, just this temporary home. You can access the few recipes I had, and lots more on the <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com">Cook's Illustrated</a> website (subscription required). Thanks to all of you who visited the site while I had those few recipes up. I appreciate the many kind notes of thanks I received during that time. I still contend that C.I. could provide a better format for the recipes, especially for searching and printing. They may have a great printed magazine, but the internet and the print world aren't the same. Too bad my requests to them for such a thing were ignored. Obviously many others appreciated those same conveniences. Oh well. Thanks again to most of you. Happy cooking/eating. :)</p>
