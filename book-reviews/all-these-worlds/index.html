<p>Another cheap &amp; easy installment in this series. I wish the books were longer, but it's not like they're lacking for story. If you're reluctant to start the series based on the potential that the series may not be finished, know that none of the books are _so_ developed and involved that you'll be left desperate to know what happens in the next book... which in this case is both a benefit and a drawback. Regardless, they're still enjoyable, and books I've laugh out loud at multiple times.</p>
