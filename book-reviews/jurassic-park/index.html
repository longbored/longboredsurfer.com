<h1><a href="//20150101-jurassic-park/">Jurassic Park</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Michael Crichton</b></p>
<p>I last read this book as a teenager, soon after the movie was released, and could hardly remember any differences between the book and movie. Regardless, this story was engaging, and kept moving right along. I've always enjoyed Michael Crichton, and miss having new books from him. With the advent of CRISPR, I keep thinking dinosaurs are just a step away.</p>
