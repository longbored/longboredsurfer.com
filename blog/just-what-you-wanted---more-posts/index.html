	<p>You didn't even need to ask. I could just tell by the way you looked at my site that you wanted more material from me. Sure, my kids are awesome, my wife is amazing, and you love reading my entries about other topics, but what you <em>really</em> want are links to other sites, so you don't have to read my original material. I read a number of things on the interweb, both through feeds as well as random surfing. I like to keep track of some of that stuff â€“ stuff that is either of interest to me, or which I think others might enjoy (or both).Previously, I used a service called ma.gnolia to keep track this stuff. Unfortunately, ma.gnolia <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/01/magnolia-suffer">went down in a flaming fire</a> (they suffered massive data loss and nobody was keeping backups (me included)). Instead of using another third party, I decided to let Movable Type's awesomenessocity <a href="/links/">track my awesome links, right here</a> on this site.</p>
<p>You may like the material, you may not. <a href="/links/atom.xml">Subscribe to the feed</a> and see what you think of it. The title leads you to the material, and you can see my own comments and sources where applicable. Additionally, I've incorporated the links into the site, and you may notice some changes as I work to further accomplish that. (P.S. Thanks to <a href="http://waxy.org">Andy Baio</a> for answering some question about how <a href="http://waxy.org/links/">his links</a> work)</p>
