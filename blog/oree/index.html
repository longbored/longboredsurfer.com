	<h1><a href="/blog/oree">-oree</a></h1>
	<p class="meta">Published on 2005-05-26</p>
	<p>Both "jamboree" and "camporee" are in my handy copy of Webster's. One of them is a national gathering of scouts, and the other is a regional gathering. They're both lame words.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about you, but I haven't see many other words that end in -oree. I can understand the root of a "camporee", but Webster's let me in on the fact that a "jamb" is "an upright piece or surface forming the side of an opening (as for a door, window, or fireplace)". I always thought that a door jamb was spelled "jam" but I never bothered looking that word up. So if we're going to follow the usage of "camporee" for "jamboree" that would me that it would be a collection of upright surfaces gathered together. That might also known as Home Depot, or a lumber yard.</p>
<p>I don't really have much to say about this, I just think it's a dumb word ending. Maybe they picked "-oree" since "-oreo" was already taken. Think of how cool it'd be to go to a "camporeo". I'm in favor of eating Oreo's while camping. None of that Hydrox crap either. A "jamboreo" would just be an edible door/window jamb. That'd be cool if you were the witch in Hansel and Gretel, but I'm not interested in cannibalism, or oreo-based jambs.</p>
<p>Other words that might seem a bit cooler if "oree" or "oreo" were added to the end...</p>
<ul>
<li>Milkoree - Dairy Farm 2.0</li>
<li>Milkoreo - Coming this fall from Nabisco</li>
<li>Freakoree - Why bother calling it a Star Wars convention any longer?</li>
<li>Tasteoreo - Bad advertising campaign</li>
<li>Whineoree - Bring the cheese to go with all these whiners</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you could come up with some great ones on your own. I haven't moved this site over to being able to make comments for nothing... Let's hear some of your ideas on this one.</p>
