<p>A great YA series, which I also enjoyed. Sometimes the end of Sanderson's books or series feel a little rushed. Although aspects of this one did, it also felt a little better paced. Comprehensively throughout the series I wish I could visualize some of the descriptions of dogfights a bit better. I also think if you're going to read this series, it's TOTALLY worth your time to read the novellas - they add details to some rather major aspects that would otherwise feel completely passed over. I can appreciate this ending the series from Sanderson's perspective, but I'll happily gobble up any additional novellas that are written.</p>
