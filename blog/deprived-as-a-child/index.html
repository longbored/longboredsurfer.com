<p class="meta">Published on 2006-12-05 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>I've never been to Chuck E. Cheese's. One time I was going to go to a birthday party there for my friend, David Rose. It was going to be really cool and I was pretty excited for it. The morning of the party I woke up and was sick, so I stayed home from school. I was feeling better as the day went on, especially knowing that the party was that evening. The heartbreaking moment came shortly before the party was supposed to start:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're too sick to go to school, you're too sick to go to the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life is so unfair. Had I seen the movie at that point in my life I might have been thinking of the part in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where they're told to "Bring out your dead!" with the one guy who's "Not dead yet" but has been written off by the other man. I had been mistaken for dead by my parents and I could see them paying the man dressed as Mr. Cheese to hit me on the head to make sure I really felt the pain. Sure, David Rose's dog bit and I didn't really like going to his house for that reason... but the party was at Chuck E. Cheese's, not his house. Yeah, I was sick earlier in the day, with a fever and everything... but to deny a child from their dreams of going to a place with nasty, overpriced pizza, and rigged games that don't put out nearly enough tickets to get that flippin' sweet toy that costs 500 tickets? That's just mean. I guess if this is how I feel deprived a child I'm not doing too bad.</p>
