	<p class="meta">Published on 2007-12-31</p>
	<p>Despite this being my third blog post in one day (and you thinking I might have nothing better to do on New Year's Eve), I wanted to take a look back at the best entries of the year, by month. Limiting myself to just one post per month is tough in some cases, so I've slightly cheated:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - <a href="/blog/in-memory-of-mr-cup-noodle">In Memory of Mr. Cup Noodle</a> - This started a little spree of mine of writing haikus on this blog. I've probably had more Cup Noodles in the past year than the previous 5 combined. No correlation.</li>
<li>February - <a href="/blog/american-idol-delusion">American Idol Delusion</a> - I feel like I've wanted to talk about that one ever since I saw the show the first time. Yes, much to my male coworkers' embarrassment (and a little to mine), I watch it still and look forward to the new season.</li>
<li>March - <a href="/blog/give-em-a-call">Give 'em a Call</a> - A new guy start at work and in his first few days somebody warned him of this quality/tendency of mine... months after I blogged about it. Go figure.</li>
<li>April - <a href="/blog/picky-eaters">Picky Eaters</a> - Continues to be one of the most perplexing things to me. I think I fairly categorized them though, which is pretty good after all this time.</li>
<li>May - <a href="/blog/mousecapades">Mousecapades</a> - Had I known how much this would impact/bother me <a href="/blog/mousecapades-ii">later in</a> <a href="/blog/two-no-wait-three-with-one-stone">the year</a>, I might have moved then. I still really like our home. Despite being born this month, she doesn't really get blogged about until late July.</li>
<li>June - <a href="/blog/superstitions">Superstitions</a> - My only entry for this month. I was busy because I was almost....</li>
<li>July - <a href="/blog/done-with-school">Done with School</a> - A horrible post to have to actually read, but a significant thing for me to accomplish.</li>
<li>August - <a href="/blog/site-revamp-again">Site Revamp... Again</a> - Mainly due to my upgrade to Movable Type 4, and also because I was bored with how it was before. Too bad I never really finished all the stuff on these lists, but I made significant progress.</li>
<li>September - <a href="/blog/recipe-collection-revamp">Recipe Collection Revamp</a> - This took a bunch of work on my part to get this up and going. Similar to the mice, had I known what would happen <a href="/blog/farewell-recipes">the next month</a>, I wouldn't have spent as much time on it. Oh well.</li>
<li>October - <a href="/blog/g2-20071012">G2 20071012</a> - Just a finishing piece to various musical adventures this year. This double disc compilation for Maria turned out to be quite a success - better than the <a href="/blog/g2-20070323">previous G2</a> this year.</li>
<li>November - <a href="/blog/unique-to-the-taker">Unique to the Taker</a> - I had a <a href="/blog/the-world-upside-down">number</a> <a href="/blog/the-vastness-of-the-internet">of</a> <a href="/blog/new-forms-of-interaction">more</a> <a href="/blog/giving-100-thanks-2007">thoughtful</a> (as opposed to humorous or mocking) pieces this year, and this was probably one of my weirdest to most of you. I've thought about this post since I wrote it, and I now see a small flaw in my theory. Oh well.</li>
<li>December - <a href="/blog/ouch">Ouch</a> - An instant classic for me. Looking at the colors I provided, it's little wonder to me why make-up colors are what they are... if people want to look bruised and battered. Go figure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I'd love to go through and pick the best pictures of the year and best events, I'm going to be honest here â€“ I know most of you don't care. Thanks for making 2007 what it was. Here's to 2008 being even better, both as a dinky blog/site as well as for each of us personally.</p>
