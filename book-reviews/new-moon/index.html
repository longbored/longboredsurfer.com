<p>Lots of build-up for very little action. After telling somebody how I little I understood the logic of the main character, they informed me that girls tend to think with their heart as opposed to their head. Although I know that's not always true, it certainly makes the main character's actions more understandable. Not the best book, but still enough to keep my attention for the others.</p>
