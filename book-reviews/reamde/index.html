<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Neal Stephenson</b></p>
<p>This is the second book I've read by Neal Stephenson, and the two books have at least one thing in common - I generally have no clue where the story is going to go next. It never feels ludicrous - just different. I enjoyed the book, but I was hoping for more laugh-out-loud moments. This review is really vague as to the actual content of the book, on purpose. I went in blind, and enjoyed it. Maybe you will as well. If you're looking for a good (albeit lengthy) warmup to Stephenson, try Cryptonomicon. It's fantastic.</p>
