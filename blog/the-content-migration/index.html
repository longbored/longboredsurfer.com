	<p class="meta">Published on 2006-02-12</p>
	<p>Well....... not that anybody but a select few people will care, but I've not migrated quite a bit of content over from <a href="http://pablonoesta.com">PabloNoEsta.com</a>. In the constant effort to get my websites up with what I originally had in mind, I'm moving over the Soap Boxes, Light Bulbs, and Lists (as well as other random posts). I've completely moved the first two (but haven't yet deleted the old ones off of there). Only the Lists elude me right now.</p>
<p>What's perplexing is that I see other sites that are powered by Movable Type, and they' amaze me. I'm not sure how they end up incorporating, yet not incorporating all their stuff. For example, every time I make a post, it appears as a blog entry. What if I don't want all of my posts to appear here? What if I want a sub-area that is essentially completely different from the rest? Take a look at a couple of the following sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Stop Design</a> (created the Blogger templates)</li>
<li><a href="http://sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> (created Movable Type)</li>
</ul>
<p>So.... both of these sites are powered by Movable Type, yet they both seem so much richer than just a generic Blog. I don't have anything against my blog... I just think it's interesting that this little system that I use to do what I do can do all that they do as well. I'm sure they're a bit more involved in their sites than I am, but I'm starting to feel like I'm being left out of some secret. Go figure. (by the way, enjoy the new/moved content)</p>
