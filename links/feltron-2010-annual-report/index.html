<p>An impressive "encapsulation of [his] father's life, as communicated by the calendars, slides and other artifacts in [his] possession." He shows the original items in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/feltron/5425650882/">this Flickr photo</a>, but has turned it into something more. I'd personally enjoy a mix of the designs and stats he's shown, along with scans and transcriptions of the actual items, in order to tell a more complete or comprehensive story (though it's probably a bit too personal to share in such a way with the entire interwebs). Either way, impressive work.</p>
