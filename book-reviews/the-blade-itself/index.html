<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Joe Abercrombie</b></p>
<p>A combination of highly intriguing, anti-climactic, and dark. While I'm intrigued by the world Joe Abercrombie has built here, I wish it weren't so bleak. The characters, while disparate to begin with, all feel like neatly fit into place by the end of the book, and their mysterious pasts and presents have come into light gradually, and still with plenty of unknown corners. There's a fair bit of detailed and graphic hand-to-hand fighting, which I struggled to follow. The language can be brusk at times. By the end of the book, while a variety of things have happened, it also feels like nothing significant has happened, but a bunch of things are on the precipice of happening.  </p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend this to most people. I already own the whole series, and will likely give the next book a try.</p>
