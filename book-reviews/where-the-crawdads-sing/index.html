<p>I only decided to read this because I've seen the movie adaptation. The book and the movie are rather well aligned. It tells the story of Kaya, and her growth from young girl to adulthood, dealing with abandonment, loneliness, ridicule, and the difficulties of people who take advantage of her. She's smart, and determined. The story is well-written, and easy to enjoy. (It's also a little excessively graphic at times.)</p>
