<div class="content"><p>I didn't know what to expect from this book. I just knew that a couple people I really like seemed to like this book, so I went for it. I liked it, too. Weirdly, despite the insubstantial premise of the story, I found my mind coming back to it. I was little prepared for how well the name of the book described the premise, or the centrality of it to the psyches of the main characters. Although I didn't love the book, it certainly kept pulling me back. I'm inclined to give it a star less, because I didn't like it as much as the book I finished before this, yet its ability to mentally pull me back talks me out of this.</p></div>
