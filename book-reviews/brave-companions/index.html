<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>David McCullough</b></p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know how David McCullough does it. Here, he presents essays or writings on various topics I didn't care about. The magic of his writing is that I now am so glad I know about them. In some cases, it extends beyond that, and I want to know even more. Really, I have yet to be disappointed by something he has written. It's just so well done.</p>
