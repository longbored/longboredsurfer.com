<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. I wouldn't recommend you read it, if you haven't read any of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy. Although this book doesn't overlap with that series, it takes place in the same world (just a few hundred years later). His semi-modernization of that world is brilliant, and I felt a connection with the characters immediately. My only complaint is that the book was so short. I certainly look forward to the other two in this second part of his trilogy of trilogies.</p>
