<p>This one was tough to make it through. I read it for a book club, and some of the chapters are heavy-handed in their approach. If I weren't religious, I'd probably like this book more. Some will argue that because of this book, I shouldn't be religious. They can get over it. Parts of this book were interesting, but not worth it overall to me.</p>
