<p>It's certainly frustrating to have somebody's child crying and for it to appear that the parent is unaware of, or unconcerned with the child - especially at this, one of my least favorite stores. I don't agree with what the man did, though I can understand that he wanted the crying to stop. For me, the highlight of the article is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The girl... was not injured, but did <em>suffer some redness in the face</em>." (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... redness in the face is now something you can suffer from? I better not exercise, go outside for long periods of time, or anything like that any more, since I don't want to suffer from any redness in the face. True suffering.</p>
