<p>I love <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/beep">@beep</a>'s <a href="http://bukk.it/">bukk.it</a>. From what I can tell, it serves various purposes for him. Possibly the most entertaining purpose, is the image-only Twitter conversations he has he has with them, where those images play center stage. Completely inspired by this collection of images, a while ago I started collecting my own set of images. My collection is lots smaller than his, and seriously pales in comparison. Despite that, I wanted my collection to <em>look</em> better to the casual browser. With that in mind, I found this handy set of files, which does just what I wanted - list files, just in a way that looks nicer than the apache system default (and fittingly enough, mentions bukk.it (though not by name) as its base example of a file listing). I quickly put these files in place over at <a href="http://g.lbs.im">g.lbs.im</a>. I added a couple pieces that would display the file size in a flexible way (in KB, MB, GB, etc), formats the date better, and also hides a couple system files that have to appear (thanks to my host). If you end up wanting those additions, I'm happy to share, just <a href="/about">drop me a line</a>.</p>
