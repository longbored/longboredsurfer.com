<p class="meta">Published on 2005-06-06 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>Before I begin, let me inform those of you who don't know - I'm overweight. I'm fat. I have what the doctors call a "little bit of a problem." I wear clothes that fit my size. I have outgrown some clothes, and therefore can't wear them anymore. Thanks to a recent trip to a local amusement park, this issue has been stirred up again in my mind. What I don't understand is when people who are overweight wear small clothes.</p>
<p>Just because you've worn the same clothes for the past 10 years (prior to any weight problems), it doesn't mean that you can still wear those clothes. Has it been brought to your attention that you're showing more skin than many people have on their whole body? I'm glad that you're comfortable with yourself, and the way you look, but the rest of us aren't. The warranty on the clothes doesn't mean that you need to go out and stress-test the quality.</p>
<p>I'm not upset with you that you're overweight. I can understand that side of it. But if you've got enough money to spend on more food, hold off on that food for just a little bit, and get yourself some new clothes instead. In case you hadn't noticed - people aren't staring at you because you're overweight, but because you're wearing the same amount of fabric as their toddler. And to make it so this isn't as personal - that little amount of fabric looks good on a select few. The reason nobody else dresses the exact same way as you is that everybody else realized just how bad it looks to wear what you wear.</p>
<p>If you're going to choose to continue to wear that amount of clothing, please only visit one of the following places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very dark theaters (and don't sit near me)</li>
<li>Sizzler</li>
<li>Your home</li>
<li>Golden Corral</li>
<li>Anywhere that we don't have to look at you</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, it's not that I have anything against people who might exceed their supposedly standard weight for the height and build. If you fall into that category, just don't dress like clothes are only intended to cover 2% of your body. It makes the rest of us think you use the same percentage of your brain.</p>
