<p>An interesting presentation style, but fitting for the non-fiction approach of the book. I've never understood these type of recluses, although I can certainly enjoy time disconnected from civilization *cough*Dome*cough*. Alexander Supertramp had his own way to discover himself and feel alive, and I think everybody else should have their way to do that as well. His style in this aspect, and mine, do not overlap.</p>
