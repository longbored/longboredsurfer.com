<p>An article at Rands in Repose called <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/09/25/trickle_theory.html">Trickle Theory</a> was very well written. Recently I had been thinking about something similar and thought the article was well worth the read. With that train of thought, I've been making efforts to tie up loose ends all over the place. This is all unrelated to an email I received from my mother about finding inner peace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Phil proclaimed:</p>
<p>"The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you've started and never finished." So, I looked around my house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished, and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle of Bailey's Irish Cream, a bottle of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the remainder of my old Prozac prescription, the rest of the cheesecake, some Doritos, and a box of chocolates.</p>
<p>You have no idea how freaking good I feel!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could be something petty but nagging, or it could be a years-old problem that you've chosen to ignore. For me, it's always most difficult to start. For me, it goes back to physics in the comparison between static vs. kinetic friction. It's tougher to start than it is to keep it going. It's not necessarily easy to do, but after you get over that initial hump, it's smooth sailing.</p>
