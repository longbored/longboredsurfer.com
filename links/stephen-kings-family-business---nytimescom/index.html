<p>I read this article about a month ago, and I haven't been able to get this piece out of my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entertaining their parents, for the King children, was part job, part enrichment. At bedtime, they were the ones expected to tell their parents stories, instead of the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever since then, I've put this into practice, recording the results. If I'm really cool, one day I'll do something with them. The results so far have been pretty fun and varied. Maybe you should give it a try.</p>
