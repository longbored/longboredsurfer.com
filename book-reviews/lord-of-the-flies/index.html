<div class="content"><p>It's just not that good. Whatever. You're up in arms about this review as it is. You saw my rating. You saw the opening of the review. You can't believe I'd say such a thing about "such a classic". The truth is rather plain - it really isn't that good.  </p>
<p>I read this book in high school, twice. My current experience with the book is very likely influenced by those early experiences with it (and the "Can we _please_ stop reading so much into this book, and just get on with things?"). I'm not interested in that sort of literature, but read this for a book club. With that in mind, I'm going to skip any of that interpretive junk, and focus on what this is - fiction. YA fiction, at best. Lazy fiction at worst.  </p>
<p>Here are my qualms:<br />
* The story starts with a bunch of boys on a deserted island. For the most part, they don't know each other. Really? Somehow all these boys (no girls, no adults) all end up in the same place, and don't know each other? Please.  </p>
<p>* The oldest of the boys, if I remember correctly, is 13. We know two boys are killed in this book. Killed. Led by one of these "older" boys, the younger ones go through with this. Really? Apart from getting a shot at the doctor's office, the thing kids are most afraid of is getting hurt or dying, and these boys, in the matter of months (at the longest) are killing each other? Right. Don't get me wrong - boys are dumb. We do all sorts of stupid things, and probably would have arrived to some point of violence at some point. Killing? Not that quickly. Fisticuffs? Probably. A coordinated man hunt? Nope.  </p>
<p>* Simon goes nuts basically out of nowhere. He's a normal kid, then one day he's talking with a pig's head on a stick. Taking advice from it (or his sub-conscious), and talking back with it. Without so much as a warm-up visit to this new decaying shrink, he's completely suckered in, and on its couch. Uh huh.  </p>
<p>* There was some lazy character development. Roger? Out of nowhere, this sadist emerges. Jack is elected leader on day one? Boys don't make decisions that quickly. They're going to feel each other out. There might be natural leaders in the group, but if you're looking for a supreme ruler in a group of boys, they're not going to choose him on day one, and stick with it, no matter if he's got some symbol of power, or not.  </p>
<p>I'm sure I could come up with more than this, but I just want to be done with this book. Should you read the book? Unfortunately, I think you should, if only for the cultural significance it'd have. But don't try to push your "insights" on the rest of us - enjoy it how you see fit. I saw it as an undeveloped, inaccurate representation of where things would go if boys were left to their admittedly-poor-decision-making own.</p></div>
