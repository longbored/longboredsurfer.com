<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>While I really enjoyed this book, and it's finalizing role in this era of this series, I can only recommend this book to people who have read not only the other three books in this era, but to people who are familiar with Brandon Sanderson's broader solar system of magical planets (known as the "Cosmere") as well. It has so many extra details about things in that Cosmere, that I feel like any reader unfamiliar with the Cosmere would be quite lost or confused about some elements of this book. Fellow fans of the series (as well as other books in the Cosmere) will probably similarly lose their mind over the fun interconnectedness of it all.  </p>
<p>As for the book itself: the characters are their usual selves - engaging and entertaining. With the end of the era, I have to assume comes the end of stories about them, which makes me sad in one case, because the character is probably my favorite of the whole series thus far. The action is fast (at times probably too fast), and the story line makes some pretty broad leaps. But it's fantasy, so the freedom to just make stuff up goes along with the genre. I look forward to the beginning of the next era, and applaud Brandon Sanderson on finishing this one.</p>
