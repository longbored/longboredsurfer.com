<p>I liked this one - but as far as these novellas go, I think it was my least favorite. It's told from the perspective of the flight leader. I don't mind him as a character, despite his more stringent ways. I enjoyed the additional background and events that were happening here in the series. All of this said, I don't think I was fully gripped by this book.</p>
