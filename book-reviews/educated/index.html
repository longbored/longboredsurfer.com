<div class="content"><p>Fascinating. I rifled through this book in less than two days. I was hooked by Tara's retelling of her journey through a crazy upbringing, in an extreme, delusional, and mentally ill family. Fittingly, I started listening to this book while on a drive from Utah to Idaho and back. I drove right through Malad, next to Buck's Peak, to/from Blackfoot - all mentioned in the book. I live in an area of people who love essential oils, and a variety of people who are into homeopathic healing (though in all cases I'm aware of, it's always combined with _real_ medical care). Combine that all with the fact that I'm an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This all makes for an enhanced experience with the book. Regardless, how remarkable her journey has been, and how inspiring it is, especially for anybody facing similarly oppressive circumstances.  </p>
<p>As a member of the Church, you catch wind of people like this. You hear they supposedly still exist, and yet part of me always dismissed it as a time gone by. Nope. Just right over there - a relatively short drive away. Crazy.  </p>
<p>I'm glad her experiences at BYU (and with her religious leaders there) were generally positive. I've seen plenty of people who are unable to disconnect a sub-par childhood or youth, with everything associated with their parents (like their religion). In so many people's minds, it's all the same. Although Tara mentions the Church frequently, it doesn't feel like she places blame on it as being responsible for the reprehensible behavior of much of her family. That said, I would hope others know just how severely the Church's leadership, members, and doctrine disagree with her family's behavior.</p></div>
