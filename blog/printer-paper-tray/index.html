<p>Did you know that you can fit an entire ream of paper in the printer paper tray at my work? Seriously, it's possible. I would imagine that it was designed that way. It's smart, there isn't any fumbling with half-reams, or guesstimating the amount of paper that can fit into the tray.</p>
<p>With that in mind, why wouldn't you put a whole ream in there? People in my area feel compelled to do just that. They take out half of a ream and stick it in there, when there is CLEARLY enough room for more paper than that. The thing that probably bugs me about the whole thing is that people then leave a half of a ream sitting around just waiting to be put in the tray.</p>
<p>To eliminate possible confusion, I went around and told everybody that uses the printer. I asked them a form of the question which started this soap box speech. Granted, there were a couple people who didn't know this amazing feat could be accomplished. I was happy to inform them of it, and the number of infractions has been drastically reduced.</p>
<p>It was brought to my attention that potentially MORE than a ream of paper could be put in the tray. Not much more than a ream could fit in there; maybe a sheet or two or so. With this new capability discovered, this person asked me why I didn't advertise that, instead of the limitation of a ream.  </p>
<p>Since my goal of telling everybody that a whole ream of paper fit in there was to eliminate the half-reams sitting by the printer, I didn't see the point of telling people that a ream+1 sheet of paper could fit in there. Telling people that it could hold that amount of paper would be just like telling them some other arbitrary number.</p>
