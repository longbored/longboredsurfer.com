<p>(Book club book). Whoa. Sleep is... important. An alternative title would be "Why we SHOULD Sleep" The author repeats the fact that he's a sleep SCIENTIST, not a sleep doctor. That said, he spend a lot of time in the book talking about studies on sleep, and the impacts of bad sleep. The studies are fascinating in their variety, and depressing in their results (if you aren't getting enough sleep). I've been far more consistent about getting sleep since reading this.</p>
