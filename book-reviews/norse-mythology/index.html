<div class="content"><p>This was fine. It's exactly what the title suggests - a collection of stories about the Norse gods. I'm either not really into the telling of tales, or potentially not really into reading them. The book had the feel of something really old, yet obviously with some modern verbiage in places. I enjoy the creativity of these types of tales, but they're not really my thing. Maybe I need to tell stories more often to my kids, and as the author suggests, do my own retelling of these stories... and by that, I'll find more enjoyment in these. As it is, I was just <em>fine</em> with this book.</p></div>
