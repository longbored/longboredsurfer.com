<p>My favorite of the series (closely followed by #4). A great story, and great cap.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Review for 11/2018: I reread the series yet again, to accompany my second oldest, who is reading them for the first time. At this point, I'm not sure this if my _favorite_ book of the series, but it's really well done. JK Rowling builds to the details and events of this book so thoroughly for the prior 6 books that it's hard to not find enjoyment in seeing it all come together. They're not perfect books, but they're pretty stinkin' good.</p>
