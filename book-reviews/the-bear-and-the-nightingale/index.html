<p>This was fine. It's simply not my style of book. I enjoyed the Russian elements to it, and the folklore mixed with religion, and some kind of magic. Unfortunately, I felt like too much time was spent on building the world and characters, and too little time in the meat of the enjoyable storytelling.</p>
