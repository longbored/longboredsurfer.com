<p>Truth be told, I wasn't always a Mac/Apple user. Our first computer at our house was actually an Amiga. Unlike Apple, they weren't able to make the crawl out of financial despair. The other day I wondered if I could actually find the old game I used to play on our Amiga back in the 80's. Thanks to this emulator, a <a href="http://tahirtas.tripod.com/Amiga/amiga2.html">kickstart ROM</a>, and the <a href="http://chomikuj.pl/chomikrewolucja/AMIGA/Compilations/Games,9">Boomerang \&amp; Dominion \&amp; Shark \&amp; Gerbils \&amp; Startrek</a> ROM, I was able to relive a moment of my childhood (although my brother claimed he doesn't recognize the game when I sent him a screen shot). That computer lived for a few more years, until we ended up with a swarthy <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_performa/specs/mac_performa_6200cd.html">Performa 6200CD</a> (with a 75 MHz PowerPC, we were livin' large).</p>
