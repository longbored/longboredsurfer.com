<p>Let's think about this slogan - "If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face." I know that I was taught very well, and I don't always perform up to my ability when it comes to manners. With that in mind however, I know I don't have the worst table manners either. If something actually <strong>does</strong> get all over the place, then I must not be doing a very good job at getting it in my face.</p>
<p>I don't want to knock anybody who eats at <a href="http://www.carlsjr.com">Carl's Jr.</a> I just ate there for lunch (thanks for the free meal, courtesy of the loser of an American Idol competition I had with a couple friends). I was with somebody who's sandwich was constructed in a faulty fashion, and was a little messy. Sometimes you just can't do anything about that. I guess you COULD bust out a fork and knife, and go that way, but that's just lame. Anyway, back to the slogan...</p>
<p>From what I understand, their only criterion for something to "belong in your face" is that it must get all over the place. Allow me to ponder a few things that get all over the place that I would never want in my face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot tar</li>
<li>A pile of ants</li>
<li>Beach sand</li>
<li>Baby poop</li>
<li>Iron filings</li>
</ul>
<p>Great logic there people. Any time you'd like any of that put in your face, please feel free to stop by my place, and I'll get it arranged for you. I could probably throw in a soft drink too, just for fun.</p>
