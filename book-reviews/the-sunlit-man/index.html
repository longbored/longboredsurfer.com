<div class="content"><p>I don't really know how Brandon Sanderson keeps coming up with new worlds and new character that I can enjoy so much. If you're unfamiliar with Brandon Sanderson's books, I wouldn't start here - though the story is more than sufficient to introduce you to things, and help you still enjoy the book. Plus, it's not <em>technically</em> part of a series, so there isn't anything to catch up on. There are just lots of connections between this book and the larger collection of books he's written. In this one, a world traveler, constantly running, and dropped into a new location, with new people, is running still. He deals with his sense of loyalty and justice, while hoping for self-preservation.</p>
<p>I'm sad this is the final book in the "year of Sanderson" (a years in which he released four books he secretly wrote during 2020, as his way of coping). What a treat all four books have been - and now the drought of books resumes. (Though as a fan of Sanderson's writing, I'm glad he's so regimented, and prolific.)</p></div>
