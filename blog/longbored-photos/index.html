<p>I've added a new photo section to LBS. It's nothing special, but it works. I have to say that I really like Simple PHP Gallery. The dude's website seems to always be down, like he hasn't paid his bill, or he gets too much traffic. Despite the site always being down, the system works like a charm. With hardly any setup, it's really easy to customize, and extremely easy to use.</p>
<p>Check out Longbored Photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/longbored/">here</a> and download a copy of Simple PHP Gallery here. I'm willing to answer basic questions.</p>
<p>Sure, I suppose I could have continued to use the gallery already setup at my other home, but that would have been the easy way out. This one is nicely built into the site, and looks good too. That, plus considering the fact that it took me less than 1/2 hour to get going... it's a little hard to beat. I hope to have less formal pictures up in this gallery, but we'll see how that goes.</p>
