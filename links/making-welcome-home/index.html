<p>I <em>really</em> liked the original Spike Jonze spot "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305ryPvU6A8">Welcome Home</a>" for Apple's HomePod. I've enjoyed several music videos by him. The combination of the music, scenery, and dancing was a home-run in my mind. Subsequently, this behind-the-scenes view is fascinating. I've had this tab open in my browser, meaning to bookmark it, for basically the past five months, and watched it several times.</p>
