<p>I'll need to revisit this one. It was too quick - and I didn't get out of it what I know it has to offer. But one thing I <em>did</em> get from it, is that I really like Brené Brown's approach to writing and teaching. I read it for a book club meeting, which doesn't meet for a while, so I'll very likely reread it before the meeting next month.  </p>

<p>I revisited this book for a book club meeting, and I'm glad I did. I'm not a fanboy of Dr. Brown, like so many seem to be, but I liked this book more the second time I read it. It's a quick book, and she has practical, approachable things we can do to make our lives a bit better. I'm grateful for books like this.</p>
