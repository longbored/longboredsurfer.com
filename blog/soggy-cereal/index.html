<p>I really dislike soggy cereal. Some cereals are better when they're a bit wetter, and that's understandable. What I have a problem with is something like Life or Crispix getting soggy.</p>
<p>I have my cereal in the morning, while at work. The other day somebody came to my desk and was talking to me while I was prepping my cereal. I have it poured in my bowl, two little cups of milk ready to pour onto my cereal. And our conversation is obviously nearing the end. I pour the milk on my cereal, and then they ask me if I can do something else...</p>
<p>I say that I would be happy to do it, but in a couple of minutes. I've just poured my milk on my cereal and don't want it to get soggy. With the most incredulous look on her face, she asked me if I was serious. Obviously unaware of the ties between a man and his food (especially one with its quality related so proportional to its need for immediate consumption), I assured her of my seriousness, and carried on eating.</p>
<p>Bewildered by my actions, she walked away in a huff. No more than a couple minutes later, I completed her request, and carried on about my business. What is it that is so hard to understand? I don't like soggy cereal. It is a rare item indeed that is of such importance that it can't wait 2 minutes. And I guarantee you that an easy bowl of Life cereal can be finished off in that amount of time.</p>
<p>Despite Carl's Junior having that whole "Don't Bother Me, I'm Eating" ad campaign... I contend that it should be a law when it comes to freshly poured milk and cereal. Seriously, just walk away and come back when I'm done.</p>
