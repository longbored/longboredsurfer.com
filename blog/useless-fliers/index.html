<p>I found great humor in Josh Millard's <a href="http://uselessfliers.tumblr.com/">Useless Fliers</a>. I immediately copied his idea, and made several of my own fliers/flyers, and posted them at work. My only problem was that I didn't want anybody to know it was me. Here we are now, months later and I still don't think anybody truly figured it out (though some were pretty close). Either way, it doesn't matter, since I've stopped. Despite that, I wanted to share my creations with you people reading the internet. Print one of these things out. Cut where appropriate. Post it. Enjoy the results. As with other creations, I'd love to hear about your own. Some of my favorite (of my own creations) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/junkforpeeps/fliers/?dir=&amp;download=Free+pieces+of+Pi.pdf">Free Pieces of Pi</a></li>
<li><a href="/junkforpeeps/fliers/?dir=&amp;download=Free+Peaces+on+Paper.pdf">Free Peaces on Paper</a></li>
<li><a href="/junkforpeeps/fliers/?dir=&amp;download=Take+only+the+Star+Wars+references.pdf">Take Only the Star Wars References</a> (not the Iranian government references)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the full listing of fliers, and download your copies to print out <a href="/junkforpeeps/fliers/">here</a>. Several of them came about as inspired by <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/">McSweeney's Lists</a> (a continual source of enlightenment). Happy posting!</p>
