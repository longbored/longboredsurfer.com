<h1><a href="/blog/20050506-talking-to-yourself">Talking to Yourself</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2005-05-06 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>If I mess up something on which I am semi-focused, I have a tendency to chastise myself there on the spot with something like "Oh.... come on man..." or "you can do better than that." During sports if I miss a shot, or make some error, I'll just say a little quick thing to myself. Maybe while watching TV and I've got some comment for what I just saw/heard, then I might say something, not caring if there is anybody else with me or not. I don't see it as any big deal. I don't respond, nor do I usually carry it beyond a sentence.</p>
<p>I view me talking myself more as me verbalizing a thought, not actually having a conversation with myself. Generally it solidifies my thoughts, is a bit of release, or is just a way to incorporate some other form of learning.</p>
<p>There are people who, from what I can tell, take this a little beyond just a simple comment. There is a person at work who seems to be talking to herself everywhere she goes. She keeps her eyes aimed at the ground, walks very fast, and seems to cover both sides of the conversation.</p>
<p>I can understand the improvement that might come with talking to yourself in conversations. I mean, think about it here. You would never have to argue, you would always be right, you would have somebody on your side, you wouldn't have to spend time trying to figure out what the other person was thinking.</p>
<p>I guess if you're going to talk to yourself, at least do the rest of us the favor of making it a little bit louder. Maybe we want to be part of the conversation as well. But in the mean time, I've thought of some things that might improve your conversations with yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Mirror - you can see the other person in the conversation when it's just you two</li>
<li>Life-size picture of yourself - others can see the mystery person involved</li>
<li>Straight Jacket - they're wonderfully comfortable and you get to hug yourself all day :)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm cool with people talking to themselves. Really, it's fine by me. I'd just like for you to let the rest of us in on what you're saying. Like those who don't understand a foreign language being spoken in their presence, we all think that you're talking about us when you talk to yourself.</p>
