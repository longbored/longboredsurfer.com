<p>An interesting book, calling out the need for helping people to understand the purpose of something before expecting them to buy in to the thing itself. That could be a product, a company, a person, or anything else. Some of his examples are wonderfully illustrative, and have held up with time. Sometimes it felt like everything was a nail, and the book's title was the hammer. I appreciate the personal applications provided, and don't find any fault with his reasoning. Still, it didn't resonate perfectly with me, and will likely be another business book I remember a couple examples from, but don't adopt as my new modus operandi.</p>
