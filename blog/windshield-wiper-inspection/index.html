	<p>My windshield wipers worked perfectly fine. They had a good clean sweep, not leaving behind any of those little water trails. I bet I could have had a whole truck-load of water poured on there at any given moment and those wipers would have taken care of it right away. They were truly wonderful wipers.</p>
<p>Sledge hammers are to walls what Jiffy Lube is to my windshield wipers. Every single time I go there, when I leave, my wipers are worse. My wipers could be PERFECT, but the workers have to go and do their twenty-some-odd point inspection, and mess them up. They take them off of the car, run their finger along them, and screw them up. It irks me every single time. How often are we supposed to be out there buying new windshield wipers?</p>
<p>Jiffy Lube would probably have you believe that every 3000 miles (or 3 months - whichever comes first) you should have an oil change, new windshield wipers, new air filter, new brakes, suspension, and oh... by the way, we'll fix that chip on your window and it won't cost you a penny - your insurance will pay for it.</p>
<p>I always find it amusing how they bring you out to the computer and talk about all the things they did to your car in that short amount of time. They like to point with their pen, and type on that keyboard that's covered with plastic. You know, the only reason they check any of it is to make more money. "Oh, ______ isn't looking very good" (and they'll show it to you, and maybe tap it on something) "Do you want to replace that? It'll only cost $___."</p>
<p>I'm not opposed to their inspection - I keep going back and pay them to do it, but just leave my windshield wipers alone. They worked just fine before, and if you touch them, then they'll stop working like they did.</p>
