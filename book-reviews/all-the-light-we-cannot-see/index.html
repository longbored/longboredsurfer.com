<p>The storylines were interesting - one from the perspective of a blind French girl, and the other of a young German radio whiz... but I wasn't fully captivated. I wish I knew more WWII history to appreciate some of the elements more. That said, I didn't feel like I missed much. Regardless, I enjoyed the storytelling approach in one of the storylines, which I won't spoil.</p>
