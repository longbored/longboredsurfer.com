<div class="content"><p>Interesting book, and fascinating view into autism. I personally don't deal well with lots of noise, and with lots of people in small spaces, and I enjoy math (factoring, prime numbers, and numerical similarities/relationships). On the flip side, I'm usually game for a hug, or even a snuggle (with my wife or kids), don't have the same irrational thought patterns, and would be happy to be rid of certain neighbor's dogs. ;)  </p>
<p>I can appreciate the logic that seems to take place in the main character's mind, and the clear and concise method he approaches everything from conversations to dealing with the unknown. The book was a quick easy read, and overall enjoyable.</p></div>
