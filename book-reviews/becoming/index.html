<div class="content"><p>Interesting, and inspiring. I admittedly struggle with memoirs or autobiographies for people who are still relatively young. Many don't seem to have a real point or purpose they're driving. Such is not the case with Michelle's book. It's evident from the title, to her own story, and the ways she and her husband worked with others.</p>
<p>What a great support system she had in her parents and others to give her a great establishment for life. It makes me wonder, as a parent (or professional), how I can help my own children get such a fortuitous footing in life, to help them and others achieve their hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>If you love or hate the Michelle and her husband in general, I felt like this book sure helped endear them to me, and give more context to their actions and ambitions.</p></div>
