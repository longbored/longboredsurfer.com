	<div class="content"><p>This was interesting. Malcolm had a rough upbringing, and then essentially was a hustler on the streets doing any and everything to make a buck, get ahead, and gratify himself. During a stint in prison, he found religion and education, and became a totally new man. I feel that his anger at history was justified. To put things very lightly - some of his opinions were strong, and some of his stances were drastic. Some points were belabored and hard to make through. I'd be interested to hear what he'd have to say about how things have progressed in the nearly sixty years since his murder. Surely he'd still be disappointed, but what further thoughts would he have? I can't pretend to fully understand the historical or current plight of others. But books like this help shed some light on <em>a</em> perspective. "One day, may we all meet together in the light of understanding." - well said, Malcolm.</p>
<p>The audio performance by Laurence Fishburne on Audible is <em>very</em> well done.</p></div>
