	<p>It's this easy: make the product easy to open. I'm not talking about certain types of products, I'm talking about all products (though Mother's (pink and white) Circus Animal Cookies are the product that made me write this). It's the worst when you're trying to open something, and not only does it open, eventually, but it opens a little excessively and either rips down the side of the bag, or essentially explodes, making stuff go everywhere. Chips seem to be a popular thing to cause these issues. Electronics are tough, but only the ones those plastic-stamped cases that require either a pair of super tough scissors, or an act of deity to open. I'm aware that some of the products are packaged in a way to either cut down on theft, or to make the product not burst open at some point pre-consumer consumption... but for all the money we spend on these freakin' things, you'd think they could invest at least <em>a little</em> in making the packages more friendly to consumers. Despite the serving size of 6 cookies, I have a ruined bag on my hands, and I'm not willing to let them go bad, just because Mother's can't engineer a decent bag.</p>
