<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Leil Lowndes</b></p>
<p>(I read this as part of a book club at work.)  </p>
<p>"How to Talk to Anyone" was first published in 1998 - which is important to understanding the context of the tips. Leil Lowndes has a clear talent in noticing human behavior. The book could use some serious updating in places. Those that are still relevant would be really helpful for coaching a variety of people to learn "normal" behaviors, or get some good ideas on how to <em>feel</em> less awkward, or get a leg-up on others. I'll be passing some on to my own children.  </p>
<p>The book is also filled with lots of cringe-inducing suggestions or stories, that don't fit in 25+ years later, and come across to me as the opinionated perspective of someone stuck in their ways. Others feel more dated than the original publication date of the book, or applicable only in very specific circumstances or circles - circles I don't run in (nor would ever want to).  </p>
<p>Like so many other professional development or self-help books, I take the good pieces from the book, and ignore the rest. Despite the cringe, the book has <em>some</em> elements I'll use or pass on to others.</p>
