<p>I enjoyed this one a bit more than the prior book in the series. Apart from these books being based in a science fiction setting, I can't really place what <em>type</em> of books these are. This one was more of a mystery. Maybe thriller? I don't know. Sometimes the language can be a bit much, but the pace of this one felt more on par with most of the series. And, fortunately for the rest of my book backlog, this is the last available book of the series, until the next one comes out later this year.</p>
