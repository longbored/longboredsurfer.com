<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>David McCullough</b></p>
<p>McCullough once again was able to make me care about something I didn't care about before. The context for the building of the bridge was fascinating. The significance of the bridge for the city, and the immigrants was amazing. This was a great book.  </p>
<hr />
<p>In 2019 I visited New York for the first time. I made a point of walking the bridge. I cried as I walked across the bridge, thinking of those people who made a similar walk, but to a new beginning. I have artwork of this bridge hanging in my home. This book made a lasting impression on me.</p>
