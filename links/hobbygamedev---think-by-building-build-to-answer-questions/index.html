<p>It's a simple concept, but one I didn't articulate on my site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A musician is more likely to dream up new songs by strumming on the guitar than by writing notes on the page. A chef is more likely to invent a new recipe by trying a bold variation on an otherwise known formula - while actively preparing the invented dish, not while sitting in the park with a pen and a notepad. A painter, no doubt, benefits by investing some mental energy in deciding on subject or approach, but I think that the genius of Mona Lisa happened while standing at the canvas with paint.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Building isn't just for final decisions, it's also for arriving at better decisions. Don't just build to keep what's built; build to think, and build to answer questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
