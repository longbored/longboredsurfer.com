<p>Interesting book, since it talks about issues with time travel. For those of you who remember Back to the Future, this book is like Marty going back and getting hit by the car by his grandfather, except in the book his name isn't Marty, he doesn't get hit by a car, and his grandfather doesn't play a role in the book.</p>
