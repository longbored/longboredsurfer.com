	<ul>
<li><strong>You can't say “Trick or Treat”</strong> - This goes mainly for infants and toddlers. <strong>*</strong></li>
<li><strong>You can't move yourself from door to door</strong> - Again for the young 'uns. Not walking yet? Ixnay. Besides your parents are going to eat it all anyway, and they're probably overweight as it is. <strong>*</strong></li>
<li><strong>You're old enough to wear deodorant</strong> (I was given my first stick in gym class in 7th grade) - I've heard a variety of time guidelines about this. I might be able to adjust this one to 8th grade as the last year.</li>
<li><strong>You didn't dress up</strong> - I can understand it being cold and you wearing a coat on the outside/inside of your costume. But if you're just in jeans and a shirt like every other day? Scat.</li>
<li><strong>You're on a cell phone while at a door</strong> - Don't have the time for me to give you some free candy? Funny, because neither do I.</li>
<li><strong>You're just going to complain about the weather</strong> - A small price to pay for pounds of free candy.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Pardonable if you're disabled in some fashion</p>
<p>Many thanks to all of the trick-or-treaters who came to my home this year (and for the past 3 years for that matter) - <strong>0</strong></p>
