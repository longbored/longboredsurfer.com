<p>Confusing, and somewhat unimpressive... but with the main characters being similarly confused, or unclear as to what's going on, I guess that's not much of a surprise.  </p>
<p>Enough people I like have recommended this series to me (namely B-Platt, Strude, Jeff, and mi Hermano), so I figured I'd give it a shot. Their recommendations seem to be for the *series*, not this particular book, so I'll trudge onward, hoping more sense (and more enjoyment) will come with the rest.</p>
