<li>The amount of whining by others about absolutely nothing would be considered "normal"</li>
<li>Placement in the 99th percentile would finally support my observations that a certain butt-kissing, brown-nosing individual is big-headed</li>
<li>We'd have support in saying that everything a certain leader says is just gibberish / baby-talk</li>
<li>It'd be understandable that some people need to have their hand held through a process</li>
<li>Napping at your desk would be expected of you at least twice a day</li>

<li>Sexual harassment suits wouldn't get filed because of a little cheek pinching</li>
<li>Attendance to AA meetings wouldn't be suggested to somebody for being on the bottle throughout the day</li>
</ul>
