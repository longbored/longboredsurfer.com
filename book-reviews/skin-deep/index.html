<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>I forgot how much I enjoyed the first Legion book. Stephen Leeds is a person with a condition in which his "aspects" (or imagined people he sees, which are entirely of his own making) are experts in their field, and help him work through cases/scenarios for which he's hired. In this particular book, a biotech company has figured a way to store data in someone's cells, but their lead man has gone missing, in a way. Leeds is on the case, with the help of his aspects to solve things. Fun, quick, easy read.</p>
