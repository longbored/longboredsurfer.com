<p>This is far more my style of a book than my prior book, yet might emerge with a similar rating. Sci-fi, with mystery. Quick writing. Familiar, but foreign setting. A little rushed, but fine for the story. Immediately started the next book. A pandemic sweeps the world. It kills some, but leaves others locked inside their own body. With the aid of technology, these people are able to resume a more normal life. This follows one of them, in a whirlwind of a first week on a new job.</p>
