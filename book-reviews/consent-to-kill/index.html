<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Vince Flynn</b></p>
<p>My request from the previous book was fulfilled in this book, and Mitch stepped up to maintain his qualifications as a true bad boy. Of all the books in this series, this one reminds me most of Tom Clancy's Without Remorse book. A truly enjoyable book and re-energizing for the remainder of the series (at least the three that are written to-date).</p>
