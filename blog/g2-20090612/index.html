<p>It's the Year of MMIX, and you need to be making a mix. We've <a href="/blog/the-year-of-the-mmix">already talked about this</a>. I don't just want say <strong>you need to make a mix</strong>, but I've now spun up the first disc to get this party started... or jam session. It's just shy of six months since I created <a href="/blog/g2-20081225">the previous G2 album</a>, but I'm back with another. Breaking from the norm, this album has less to do with my love for my wife, but more to do with a theme of music. I really aimed for music one could just chill out, lounge around, put this album on, sip a drink, enjoy some conversation and good company... and be perfect. Additionally, it'd be something that I think I could play if/when Maria and I sit out on the deck in the evenings together.</p>
<p>There were a couple exceptions to that calmer approach, but for the most part these songs are right up that line of thought:</p>

<p>Since this album was more theme-centric than amorous, I'm happy to explain a bit about the music. When I think of a lounge, in my mind I see a 60's or early 80's scene, with washed out colors and design typical of the era. I tried, but don't know if I nailed that quite perfectly with this approach. The folded front of the album up top obviously lets the letters bleed quite a bit.</p>
<p>The entire album was based on the first track, which is unfortunately not available on any online store I can find. It <em>is</em>, however, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFHEJKD3sY">available on YouTube to listen to</a>. I originally had this song, followed by Drugs or Me (Styrofoam Remix) by Jimmy Eat World, but remembered that song was actually on the <a href="/blog/g2-20070323">G2 20070323 album</a> (so not a candidate for this G2).</p>
<p>A lot of the tracks are songs that I enjoy, but other people might not. Some are clearly not in the same style as the rest of the album, and others are questionable in taste. The refix/remix of Clint Eastwood (track 11) is easily the standout tempo-wise, but somehow I think it works. I'm pleased with the overall combination of songs.</p>

<p>The album's artwork came together really well.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk">Chunk</a> was the typeface this go-around. Not only did it serve as the typeface, but as some of the inspiration to the layout.</li>
<li>I actually got the colors off of a <a href="http://quiccs.deviantart.com/art/Amputa-Bangiz-Standard-TTF-122444794">layout for the Amputa Bangiz typeface</a> - not a typeface I'm likely to use today, but the colors worked well (I found both this, and Chunk referenced in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/05/beautiful-high-quality-free-fonts-for-your-designs/">a recent Smashing Magazine article</a>).</li>
<li>No, the giant dots don't perfectly flow around the bottom of the album. You'll just have to deal with that, since I wasn't trying.</li>
<li>A little bonus bit: instead of the usual song/artist separator of <strong>-</strong> I went for <strong>:</strong>. Lots of circles and dots on this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter the reasoning, or excessive design babble, I hope you enjoy it, but I hope Maria enjoys it more. <a href="/blog/the-year-of-the-mmix">You still need to make a mix</a>. Start.</p>
