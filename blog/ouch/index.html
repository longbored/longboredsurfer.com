<p>Pop Quiz (Hot Shot), which of the following colors was not on the middle toe of my right foot after I carelessly spent too much time barefoot outside helping to clear up a clogged rain drainage system and misplaced my foot and consequently jammed the bejebus out of said toe:<img alt="Bruised Toe Colors" src="ouch.gif" /></p>
<p>The correct answer is: none of the above (they were all on there). Yes, it hurt. A little ibuprofen and a couple days and it seemed to be almost fresh as new. Just be glad I didn't upload the actual picture of my foot for you to stare at. Imagining the colors is ugly enough. ;)</p>
