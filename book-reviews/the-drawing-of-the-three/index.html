<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Stephen        King</b></p>
<p>A far more traditional-style story than the first book in this series, and much more enjoyable as well. Roland (the last gunslinger) faces his fate of three doors, attempting to find a path towards the tower that draws him nearer. I found great humor in his take on the foreign objects and places. This story piques my interest far more than the first book would have all by itself.</p>
