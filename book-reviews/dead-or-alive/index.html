<div class="content"><p>Either Tom Clancy is losing his pacing, or this book was written more by the co-author on this (Grant Blackwood) was the slow one. Either way, despite it being an enjoyable story, I felt it was a little slow. Additionally, I question (more and more as the series goes on) the plausibility of the series. I liked how independent Teeth of the Tiger felt, but it seemed that this book was trying to wrap the story line back in to the rest of the series... which I think is unnecessary. He need to not wait so long in between books in this series if he hopes to keep up with the other authors in this genre (a genre that feels like was invented or mastered by Clancy).</p></div>
