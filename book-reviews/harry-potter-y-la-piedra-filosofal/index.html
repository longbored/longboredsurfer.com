<p>I'm not going to bother reviewing the actual book. It's Harry Potter - if you haven't read it, you should. Reading it will help you understand the pop culture references to it. You may or may not like it. It seems at this point, that the majority of people like it. You're not a bad person if you don't like it.  </p>
<p>The first time I read the first four Harry Potter books, I read them in Spanish. Consequently, the characters were an interesting mix of Hispanic/British for a long time. I remember reading Hermione's name, and having never seen the name beforehand, and having no clue how to pronounce it, the name was engraved as "air-me-OWE-nay" (because that's how it would be pronounced in Spanish). Good times.</p>
