<p>I'm loving this "golden age of apples". I hated apples for a long time, because Red Delicious apples were only true to the first half of their name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bedford says the world of commercial apples has two phases: before Honeycrisp and after Honeycrisp. Before, there were basically two categories to describe texture, he says: soft/mealy or hard/firm/dense. "With Honeycrisp, we had to redefine what texture was," Bedford says. That texture was so distinctive and delightful that it has become the basis for many of our new apple varieties, which is why such a large number of them have the word "crisp" in their name. "Once you've had crisp," he says, "it's hard to go back."</p>
