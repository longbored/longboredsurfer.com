<p>Despite my complete unfamiliarity with Nightvale (the books, podcasts, shows - everything, really), this book easily brings you into a story without feeling foreign. The story has some rather creepy/unpleasant elements to it, which can be quickly passed over. The main story is enjoyable, taking place in Europe and on the Mediterranean, involving banditry, revenge, and careful planning. Make no mistake though - this book would fall into the category of horror - a genre I tend to avoid.</p>
