<div class="content"><p>Still young, fresh out of prison, with a dead father, and a mother that has abandoned them, a young man and his kid brother go on an adventure, in hopes of following the Lincoln Highway to its end to find their mother. Before their journey even begins a wrench is thrown in the works, and... basically keeps happening.</p>
<p>Towles tells a good story. I understood the characters, and got a feel for their motivations, and yet I also felt like I was kept guessing on what would happen next. I also liked how the story was told from the perspective of a variety of the characters in the book.</p></div>
