<div class="content"><p>Maybe this is too self-referential, but I have to believe that everybody can see a bit of themself in Ove. I appreciate his practical view/manner at undertaking a task, as well as how he is willing to learn a new skill. It's a great story. I also enjoyed how the author told the story - in a way that slowly revealed more of the past as it told more of the current story. I feel like it made the story easier to approach. Additionally, I found myself laughing out loud at this book, which is always a nice treat. All said, I flew through this book, and loved it.</p></div>
