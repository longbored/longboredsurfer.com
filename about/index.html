<h1>About</h1>
<p><img alt="Me, in Kindergarten" src="/img/avatar_kid_90x90.jpg#image_right" /> Online, I go by Pedro (though I respond to it offline as well). By day I'm a data geek (writing tons of SQL and Python). By night I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a husband, father, mac geek, and perpetual micro-hobbyist. 'Why long<strong>bored</strong>?' you say? I was very bored with a previous job, and I came up with this site one dark evening. My family has been my wonderful cure to boredom, and my <a href="/links/">links</a> give a good summary as well as this photo:</p>
<p><img alt="Header" src="/img/header_400.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you're text-oriented, here are some things I like (in no particular order, and to varying degrees): web design &amp; development, Apple (macOS &amp; iOS), playing video games (Nintendo (Zelda, FTW), Minecraft), listening to music, watching sports (LA Dodgers, San Antonio Spurs, Liverpool Football Club (YNWA)), building LEGO sets, playing board games (MtG, Dice Forge, Cribbage, &amp; Quacks) &amp; trying new food. Probably other things too. Like sentence fragments.</p>
<h2>About the Site (basic colophon)</h2>
<p>I love my Mac, and have done everything for the site on it. My preferences are with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> - graphics</li>
<li><a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> - general text editor</li>
<li><a href="https://nova.app">Nova</a> - HTML &amp; CSS tweaks</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> - my current preferred Python IDE</li>
<li><a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> - FTP</li>
</ul>
<p>For the actual web side of things, my grandmother, mother, and dead dog have no clue, but I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom Python-based static-site generator, which some day I might be willing to share.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d4c2de3db3cd">DigitalOcean</a> - runs this site (and others) and does an incredible job at it. Really, I freakin' love them. (Want to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d4c2de3db3cd">help pay for my hosting</a>? Gee, that'd be real nice of you!)</li>
<li>(though now that the site is just a git repo, I swapped to AWS, which is ridiculously simple for a static site from a repo. But I still have my DigitalOcean server, for now)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, some people (see: hardly anyone) might care to know I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@longbored">Mastodon</a> - Because the reasons/people I used Twitter have largely left, but I still care about them</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/longbored">Goodreads</a> - book reviews - though I also host copies of these here <a href="/book-reviews/">on my site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/longbored">Twitter/X</a> - I used to be much more active on here, but so many who I followed left, and they killed off third-party clients. So, this is essentially dead to me.</li>
<li>A handful of other socially-oriented sites that handle a bunch of random things for me... but those are of even less interest to even fewer people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact Me</h2>
<p>If you want to contact me, send me an email using my pseudonym at this domain. To avoid spambots, that's as much of a hint as I'll give.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>By day, I've worked for various companies doing Business Intelligence work - from data crunching via SQL or Python to making sense of that data through some reporting tools, I'm all over it. If you think I might be able to help you on a project, reach out.</p>
