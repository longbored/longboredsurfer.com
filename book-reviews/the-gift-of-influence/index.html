<p>While some of this book could come across as grandstanding and bragging I appreciated the basic premise of the book. Be kind to others. Treat humans like humans. Be honest and hold to your word. These things are important, and make a difference. I know somebody else who had similar teachings. I think He was onto something.</p>
