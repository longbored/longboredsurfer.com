<p>I expected to dislike this book. I did not. Instead, I found myself being slowly drawn in to the author's way of thinking, as he goes quest to find joy (and no injuries) from running - not just running, but long-distances. Along the way, he meets a variety of people with insights into what makes the human race evolutionally born to run - from our bodies, to our diet, different running styles, and even the cushioning (or lack of) in your shoes (if you're even wearing any).  </p>
<p>I still hate running.</p>
