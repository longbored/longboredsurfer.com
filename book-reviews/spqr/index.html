<p>Interesting, but not as interesting as it could have been had I been better versed in Roman history. Yes, that's circular logic - "In order to enjoy this book on Roman history, I feel like I needed to be better versed on Roman history." With that in mind, I enjoyed the last portion of the book the most that talked about the daily lives of the people, and how things likely were then. Julius Caesar himself is an interesting figure (as was Augustus), but this isn't the book to become acquainted with him/them.</p>
