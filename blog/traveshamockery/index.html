	<p>I only watch a few shows faithfully on TV. One show that I REALLY enjoy is called <a href="http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/">Arrested Development</a>. Just recently I read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/11/television.shows.reut/index.html">the announcement</a> that they will be canceling the show in the middle of its third (current) season. An Emmy winning show that just didn't get the ratings. How sad.</p>
<p>I enjoy witty humor, since I tend to display that for myself. The show exemplifies how I believe TV should be done. It makes you think, and doesn't just do lame pie-in-the-face tricks to make you laugh. The show was previously on Sunday nights (for 2 seasons), and this year they moved it to Monday night. Now, after they finish their 13th episode this season, they'll be done for good. Fox hosts truly worthless shows like Stacked and The War at Home, yet ditches the show that actually wins them awards. It may not be as popular as American Idol, but it certainly had at least 1 loyal fan. Despite this boring blog, and my attempts to communicate my dissatisfaction, I wanted to vent a little, knowing that it will make little to no difference. My condolences to Fox for having lost one of its truly valuable shows. A travesty, a sham, and a mockery. A traveshamockery. If you feel the same way, please feel free to write a little letter:</p>

<p>If not, please feel free to stick it in your ear.</p>
