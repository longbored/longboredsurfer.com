<p class="stars">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>Churchill was a truly remarkable person. Surely not without faults, but it feels like he was one of those people history will continue to look back on with gratitude. Between his physical courage, escaping from prison of war camp, tuned speaking approaches, foresight on Germany, dozens of written books, and insatiable curiosity, I kept marveling at him.  </p>
<p>I don't know if it's the book, or the subject matter, but this was great. Despite the book's overwhelming length (1,100+ pages / 50+ hours on Audible), it never felt like the book lagged. I'd need to read another book on him to have a better clue on whether I like Churchill more because of who he was, or how this was written (or both).</p>
