	<p>So, I think I've finished the initial design of the site. All pages that are available in the site should now be this new format. Not only that, but they should be easily updateable when any new stories are posted. The old site design just wasn't working out.</p>
<p>It ended up that the very original site design was uh... unreliable. It would work perfectly on some browsers, but on others it just plain 'ol sucked. I couldn't figure out the reason as to why, so I went with a design that worked very well on every browser I tried. Instead of coding something specific to a browser, the universal approach was better. This new design has some custom graphics in there, and some other stuff. I will probably be swapping around the colors shortly, so that I don't keep up with the current colors. (Thanks to blogger in the mean time for letting me borrow this design).</p>
<p>I noticed that the initials that I've used for the place might be able to be turned as something else. LBS. I'm going more for the LongBored Surfer. I supposed that TLS would probably work better. LBS might be able to be twisted as El Bull Sh*t, or El BS. And since I'm stuck with my latino side of things, I couldn't help but notice that one. I'd ask for your input, but I've also handily disabled comments on this place for the time being. Think it's kinda funny still.</p>
