<p>What an enjoyable book. I'm not sure I can come up with more than that fairly simple review. Sure, technically the book is science fiction, and it's about a kid, and both of those things will likely put off some people. Despite that, it's a really enjoyable book. I finished it in two days, since I felt so wrapped in to the book. I'm not sure how much more of an endorsement I can give a book.</p>
