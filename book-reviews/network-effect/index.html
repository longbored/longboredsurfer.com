<p>Maybe the shorter format of the prior books was more of a benefit to them than I thought. This book felt like it dragged substantially, and I found myself zoning out repeatedly. Maybe I just had other stuff on my mind? Maybe I couldn't bring myself to really care about the antagonists? Still, I really like Murderbot. I'm okay with emotions.</p>
