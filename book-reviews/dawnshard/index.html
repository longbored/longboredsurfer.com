<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>It's interesting to see Brandon Sanderson work on his immensely large epic fantasy series (The Stormlight Archive), in something bite-size like this book. So much of his storytelling in this series takes a long time to build. In the 270 pages of this book, he was able to lean on what he's already built, yet give a totally separate story that somehow feels integral to the rest of the series and beyond. Not only that, but he was able to make me connect to the characters <em>even more</em> while they learn lessons that may or may not have hit close to home.</p>
