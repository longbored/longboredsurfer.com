<p>Since I'm still a geek at heart, I constantly spend time to upgrade and improve junk. Such is the case here with Longbored Surfer. You may have noticed that today's date is now always populated there in the upper left-hand side (thank you PHP). I've also fixed the "Remember Me" checkbox on a story's page (appears I took out a link to a java script). I added the ability to subscribe/unsubscribe to emails about when I update the site (all automated (and now all removed)). I also added the ability for anybody to email any story to somebody. It really just sends them a link so they can come here and read the story. Trivial though these upgrades may be, I think they're pretty cool.</p>
