<p>In 2007 I started The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although Robert Jordan passed away, Brandon Sanderson was asked to finish off the series. I've contemplated how that must feel, and I wholeheartedly agree that if I were to do that, "The biggest struggle [would be] the sheer weight of characters." I don't envy his position, but I sure look forward to the next release. (Also... I'm enjoying <a href="http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=13372">The Wheel of Time Re-Read</a> going on over at Tor.com. Very interesting to hear/read others opinions about the series.)</p>
