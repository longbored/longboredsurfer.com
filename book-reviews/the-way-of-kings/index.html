<h2>Original review: I was skeptical about the book, and not initially as engaged by the more fantasy-based parts. Despite those things, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I very eagerly await the next installment, and can only applaud the author for creating such great characters, and a rich world. Very cool.</h2>
<p>11/5/2020 review: I can't believe I've only track two of my readings of this book, when in reality I've read it 5 or 6 times. I still think this is a really enjoyable book, very nicely built in a world and society that seems both understandable, yet very unique. I love the characters and various story lines. Each time I'm excited for things, even though I already know what's going to happen.</p>
