<p>Mister Rogers gets a full 10 out of 10. His consistency as an advocate for children, and caring for others is remarkable. There are so many nuances to his show and his behavior that I simply didn't notice before. This book shed new light on those, and I appreciate that insight. As for the book itself, there were parts that <em>really</em> dragged - admittedly to the point that I had abandoned the book several months ago. Thanks to a book club nudge, I needed to finish the book, and I'm glad I did.</p>
