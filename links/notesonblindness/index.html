<p>John Hull, a writer and theologian, became completely blind in 1983. He kept a diary on an audiocassette. This film is a dramatization of some of of his words and thoughts. I loved it, and feel like it's a shame I didn't see it closer to its original release. I'm going to eagerly devour <a href="http://nytimes.com/notesonblindness">the story and additional material</a> behind it.</p>
