	<p class="meta">Published on 2005-05-19</p>
	<p>Certain music is generally accompanied by certain vocabulary. It wouldn't be uncommon to find some expletives in rap, or rock. Country songs are generally accompanied by similar country-like vocabulary. The content of the songs would probably fall into the same general category. A rap song is less likely to talk about fishing than a country song would.</p>
<p>I've BSed a paper or two in my day. Okay, so maybe that might be a dozen or two, but that's not important. The important thing in BSing a paper is to know yourself well enough to know if you're doing a good job at the made-up paper. I know that I am NEVER going to insert any Latin phrases into my paper, no matter what. Et cetera might be the only thing, but I would generally abbreviate that one, just like everybody else does. So if I'm not going to use any Latin, why use a Latin phrase that a Thesaurus give me? Just to sound intelligent? Whatever.</p>
<p>I was listening to a song recently and was a little thrown off by the use of a word. The artist said the word "mycelium" (although it very well could have been moselium). Is it just me, or do you know what that first one is without <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=mycelium">looking it up</a>? It's not that I don't understand the definition, but it's just not one of those that happens to find its way into my daily speaking.</p>
<p>From what I can tell this artist was going a little nuts with his thesaurus or rhyming dictionary. I can't even think of a word that might rhyme with that. I know this isn't like "orange" that supposedly doesn't have a rhyming word. I think this guy went a little beyond, that's all.</p>
<p>Similar phrases which I don't expect to find in a modern rock song which is actually played on the radio, and not just played by some crappy local band</p>
<ul>
<li>I hooked up with a girl from the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2005/05/05.html">claque</a>.</li>
<li>Our managing company was like a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2005/05/16.html">camarilla</a>.</li>
<li>Dressed like a farmer her threads were very <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2005/04/11.html">malapropos</a>.</li>
<li>Prone to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2005/04/26.html">matutinal</a> drinking, I started to think I had a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a fan of knowing your own language and being able to speak it well. Vocabulary is fine by me, and I hope that yours grows as you see fit, but let's stop the talk about the mycelium in the rock songs.</p>
