<p>I finished this book less than 5 minutes ago. I really enjoyed where this book was going in the series - it's another great installment. But, the book just... ended. Like, it was in the middle of two major storylines, and simply ended unceremoniously. Although I have theories as to why the book would end where it did, it just doesn't really matter. I guess I'll start the next one in the series.</p>
