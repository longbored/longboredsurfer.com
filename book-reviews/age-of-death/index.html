<p>I’m not a fan of the cliffhanger endings which these last two books have had. However, this book’s ending felt like a more natural point to pause the story, however briefly. I’m glad I waited for all the books in the series to be released before I read the series, otherwise the cliffhangers would have been <em>really</em> annoying. This book went to a new place, in a variety of ways. I’m interested to see how the final book wraps things up, with so many new things introduced.</p>
