<p>Quick. Gripping. Really enjoyable. I fired through this thing in a few days, and when I wasn't with the book, my mind kept going back to it. A murder mystery in reverse, with a time (travel) loop, and revelations that are unexpected, yet realistic. It won't be nearly as good on a second read-through, but the first time was really fun. (And I'm glad to see the person I know and love who is a sucker for time travel books has already read this one.)</p>
