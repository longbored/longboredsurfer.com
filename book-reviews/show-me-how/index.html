<p>I wanted this book more for the illustration and design and I wasn't disappointed by either of those aspects. Additionally, I was pleased to learn a few things that might actually be do-able, as opposed to some of the far-fetched examples they have in the book (like how to snuggle with a hedgehog or wrestle and alligator). Although I liked the book, I doubt most people would want to OWN the book - probably worth a flip-through or two for most people.</p>
