<p>I've been wondering how things would be if our globe was pictured the opposite of how it is nowâ€”Antarctica at the top of the world, Canada and Russia at the bottom. Keep north pointing towards the top of the globe, and south towards the bottom. How has our/my mentality of the world been molded by how I see things laid out on a map, or a globe? Take all of your feelings, whether you're totally aware of them or not, about the north and south and swap them. Here are couple thoughts I've had about it, and some I just came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The North would have lost the Civil War, and us southerners would be just as thrilled (the Civil war is filled with fun swaps)</li>
<li>North and South Dakota and Carolina?</li>
<li>I might feel more distant from Santa's home at the North Pole</li>
<li>It would be "Down Home Northern Cookin'"</li>
<li>The majority of modern civilization would be in the South</li>
<li>I wouldn't think the Southern Hemisphere's weather and seasons were all that weird</li>
<li>Would people still have seen the boot in Italy, or just a weird shape?</li>
<li>New England would be the southern peninsula of the US, not Florida</li>
</ul>
<p>Those aren't really earth shattering... just... different. It's interesting to swap your thinking about something that is so universal (in our little world). Imagine the different take on things had that been the way. One reason I think the North has become the top of the world is only that it <em>is</em> where modern civilizations started. Once they figured out there was more than just their little village, they put themselves in the presumably dominant position - on top. I've never taken any sort of classes that would discuss things like this, but it was just something I was thinking about. Just wanted to share.</p>
