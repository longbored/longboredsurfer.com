<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Markus Zusak</b></p>
<p>An interesting, and very human experience of some of WWII from the perspective of some quietly resisting German civilians. I enjoyed getting a taste of the German culture through the experiences of Liesel, and her foster parents. I think we've all tried to imagine what we would have done in their place, and I feel like this book did a good job adding some realism to that imagination.  </p>
<p>Now, if only I could stop thinking of the words "saumensch" and "saukerl", I'd be all set.</p>
