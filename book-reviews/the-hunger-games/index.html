<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Suzanne Collins</b></p>
<p>I had no clue what the book was about, just that nearly everybody on GoodReads had read it. I figured if people were so positive about it, I might as well see what the hype was about, and read it. Now that I have (technically I listened to it), I can't believe so many females enjoyed it. Apart from the female protagonist, I couldn't see what would have drawn most in. Despite that, I rifled through this book. The premise was bizarre, the story was engaging (though too predictable), and I'll be curious to see how the next book continues.</p>
