<p class="meta">Published on 2019-03-09 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>A while ago I <a href="/links/3d-print-a-fisher-price-record">linked</a> to <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-printing-records-for-a-Fisher-Price-toy-record-/">an Instructable</a> on how to create your own Fisher Price record. For Christmas, I decided to actually go for it, and make one of these for my kids.</p>
<p>I opted to keep the theme appropriate, and do a couple songs my kids would appreciate, so I went for two children's hymns. I could easily find the music for <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/teach-me-to-walk-in-the-light?lang=eng&amp;_r=1">Teach Me to Walk in the Light</a> and <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/jesus-wants-me-for-a-sunbeam?lang=eng&amp;_r=1">Jesus Wants me for a Sunbeam</a>. My job was to transcribe that music into Fred Record Player.</p>
<p><img alt="Fred Transcribed Music" src="fred_transcribed_music.png" /></p>
<p>One of the main challenges was that some notes literally don't exist in the actual record player (and subsequently, aren't provided in the tool). So, I had to adjust the key of the music, to make it still sound right, despite the adjustment. Even still, on one of the songs there was one note I couldn't get perfect. Good enough.</p>
<p><img alt="Fred Raw File" src="fred_raw_file.png" /></p>
<p>You can see the raw music file isn't anything fancy, but I wouldn't have any concept of what the song sounds like without the Player itself. Also, the Fred Record Player generates the OpenSCAD file. Somehow it translates that somewhat simple file into a series of instructions the 3D-file generator can follow.</p>
<p><img alt="OpenSCAD Code" src="openscad_code.png" /></p>
<p>It uses those instructions to generate the rendering of the record itself. It's kind of cool - you can see the little pips it is generating around the main grooves.</p>
<p><img alt="3D Rendering" src="3d_rendering.png" /></p>
<p>OpenSCAD is responsible for generating the <code>.stl</code> file. That's the file you need to use to actually print the record. I don't yet have a 3D printer, so I opted to print the record through <a href="https://www.shapeways.com">Shapeways</a>. It took about 10 days for my order to show up at my home, and it plays perfectly. I know this is super nerdy, but if it's actually of interest to you, and you're even remotely computer capable, you can likely pull something like this off as well.</p>
<p>Whether you'd like some of the intermediate files, or if you'd simply like to print this exact same record, I've attached the files for you. Happy making!</p>
