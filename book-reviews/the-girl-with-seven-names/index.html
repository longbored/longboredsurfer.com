<p>This was so fascinating. I found any excuse to go back to continue reading. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't simply a work of fiction, but somebody's actual life experience. We get glimpses of the backwards life in North Korea, but this sure helps shed light on it. What an oppressive regime, and what a nightmare to go through to enjoy the things we find as commonplace in so many other places.</p>
