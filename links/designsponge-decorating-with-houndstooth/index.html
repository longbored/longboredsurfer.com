<p>I can enjoy houndstooth as well, though I'm not obsessed with it. Anything that has such a cool name probably deserves some level of attention. I think the wallpaper would be cool to have on a small wall (because it would probably make my eyes bleed on a huge wall), though $85 for a single roll is... excessive.</p>
