<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>F. Scott Fitzgerald</b></p>
<p>This book was fine. I've read some other books published around the same time as this, and the similarities stand out more to me than the story itself, really. The language of the book is overly descriptive in some areas, and intentionally vague in others. The narration seems unenthusiastic and even aimless at times. The phrasing feels out of place in our world - largely formal, and distant. Not to mention the people themselves.  </p>
<p>I'm glad I never read this book connected to schooling. I can only imagine how much it could be overanalyzed. I'm in no position to say if it's the amazing classic it's made out to be. As a casual reader, it was just that - fine. I hope it's a wonderfully accurate depiction of some of the things of this time period, though the casual racism of the era always throws me off.  </p>
<p>I enjoyed the mystery of the book - around Gatsby himself, as well as some of that narrative style, not to mention the concluding events of the book. My interest was piqued early, and I was curious to know more.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day, I'm likely to reread this at some point, simply because it's so short, and representative of the era, but not because it's some incredible story by today's standards.</p>
