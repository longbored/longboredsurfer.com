<p>I'm to the point that I think my site is bloated. Although I like Movable Type (which is what runs this site), it's too heavy these days for what I need/want out of a site. Kirby CMS is almost in the complete opposite direction - a completely file-based CMS. I've been toying with it locally for a few weeks, and although I'm not ready to say I'm going for it, I can certainly see examples of how/when I'd use it. $40 to be database free, and insanely flexible. Very very tempting.</p>
