<p>I read this for a book club at work. The book was chosen by the group. I went into it without any <em>real</em> thoughts of myself as a perfectionist, but walked away with so many great insights to my perfectionist tendencies, and how to both harness and address some of the strengths and downfalls that those tendencies include. Going in, I also thought the book would be super dry, based purely on the cover. It wasn't at all. I'd happy read this again to discuss with others.</p>
