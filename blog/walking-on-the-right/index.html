<p>Walk on the right side. It's just that simple. Everybody else seems capable of figuring that out, just not you. There are some idiots who continue to walk down the left side, figuring that everybody else is doing it wrong. Ever noticed that we drive on the right side of the road?</p>
<p>In other countries, where driving occurs on the left side of the road, I can understand how people might walk down the left side. Be that as it may, but here in the U.S.A. we walk on the right.</p>
<p>The problem comes with those people who choose to walk on the left. If you're in a hallway, then they're aiming right at you, yet everybody else doesn't do that. Those blind corners? Nothing but awkward situations of saying "excuse me" when really it's their fault that they can't walk on the correct side. Sidewalks? I can understand when a group of people are walking together and they want essentially all keep the same pace... but you've at least got to give the opposing traffic space for AT LEAST one person to pass.</p>
<p>Please walk on the right side of the hallway, sidewalk, corridor, whatever. The rest of us just want to shove you onto your butt and make you cry when you walk on the incorrect side.</p>
