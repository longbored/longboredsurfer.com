<p>Okay, it's official now. I'm not sure if anybody noticed it, but we're here now at the new domain of <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com">LongboredSurfer.com</a>. If you typed in the old address, you'll have been forwarded here automatically. No longer am I limited to being a sub-domain... I'm my own whole domain. Hopefully with this place being here, I'll really take advantage of it all. Glad to have you here. Welcome... again... to The Longbored Surfer. Yippie! (happy Groundhog Day, by the way... go watch that fabulous movie!)</p>
