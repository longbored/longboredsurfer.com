<p>I've been enjoying this season's Layer Tennis, and somewhat agree with <a href="http://northtemple.com/2009/05/01/im-going-to-go-ahead-and">Jason Lynes</a> that this may be one of the best matches I've seen. Although the first couple layers were battle-ish, the remainder gave much more of a feeling of collaboration than competition. Very well done (plus we'll give them credit for using the Futura typeface on the same site that laud's it in their Field Notes products).</p>
