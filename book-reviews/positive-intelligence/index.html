<p>My mind just keeps going back to this book, and the things it teaches and reinforces. It's one of those books I wanted to talk about with everybody around me while I was reading it. In short, we all have mental saboteurs, which we have potentially (and unintentionally) let play too significant of a role in our thinking, outlook, reactions, etc. We can identify those saboteurs within ourselves, counteract them, and find more meaning and success.  </p>
<p>The author, Shirzad Chamine, doesn't claim this is original material, but a collection of things utilized by others. Probably due to my familiarity with those other areas, Chamine's approach rang really true with me. I can't claim to have turned my life around due to this book, but on I can attest that another book has been my "short list" of self-help and business books I'd actually recommend.</p>
