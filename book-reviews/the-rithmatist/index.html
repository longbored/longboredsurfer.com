<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>Despite what I felt was a slow start, by the end of the book, I was champing at the bit for more - which there clearly will be. This is aimed at a more young adult audience, but I've read nearly everything else by Brandon Sanderson. Not his best work, but he has still built a enticing world, and characters with personalities.  </p>
<p>The gist of it: Joel, a student at a school that also educates/trains Rithmatists - people who can bring chalk drawings to life, is enlisted to help investigate the strange disappearances of students. I don't really want to spoil it for you. So, that'll do.</p>
