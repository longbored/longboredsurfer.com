<p>Maria had me rearrange our bedroom last night. I think a great activity at 9:15 in the evening would be to rearrage a room. Holding stuff off for the weekend is so overrated. Let's shift a desk, bed, pair of bed-side tables, couple filing cabinets, sewing/craft table and other random crap around the room right before we're supposed to go to bed. Sounds like a great idea..... not.</p>
<p>But, I'm a sucker for the rearrange, so I did it. I now have my bed underneath the window, the desk on which I frequently write these entries is now on a small wall opposite the bed, pinned between the closet and the bathroom.</p>
<p>The debate came up about the use/appearance of a room. Should it be a useful room or a 'pretty' room? Unfortunately we live in a rather small place, so we don't have the space to have all the various areas in a bunch of different rooms. We opted more in the direction of function, as opposed to beauty. Should I have bothered with Feng Shui? From what I understand, in order to pull that stuff off, your space-to-stuff ratio needs to be a bit higher than what ours is.</p>
<p>Oh well, hope she likes the setup, since I don't really want to rearrange again at that hour of the evening.</p>
