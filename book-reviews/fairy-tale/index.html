<h1><a href="//20221015-fairy-tale/">Fairy Tale</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Stephen King</b></p>
<p>King seemed to spend a third of the book building a detailed world, which he then abandoned. The fantasy world he also built was rich, and involved. Some of the parts of the story dragged a bit, but unlike some of his other books, there wasn't an overly graphic sex scene. I could see any number of books similarly inhabiting this same world - either the real world, or fantasy world he built.</p>
