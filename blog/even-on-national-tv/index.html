<p>I was watching American Idol the other night, and one of the contestant's mother and aunt were on the show making fools of themselves and the contestant. Anna Nicole Smith (sorry, no haiku about her) died, and her mother was fighting for the right to her body, and wasn't exactly in the best condition either. These things, added to any number of other experiences in my life, have reminded me that no matter how famous, how old, how prominent, successful, loving, kind, or careful you might be... your parents can still embarrass you.</p>
