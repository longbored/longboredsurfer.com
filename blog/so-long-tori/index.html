<p>I noticed that <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0005455/">Aaron Spelling</a> died yesterday. I can't help but feel sorry for those he left behind, since more often than not, death doesn't come at the most convenient time. I was amazed to read about his career, and everything that he had done. If there is any good news that comes with this though, it hopefully means that we don't have to see his poorly acting, fugly daughter on TV anymore. Here's to you Aaron, for bringing happiness to others, even when you're dead.</p>
