<p>This world is so foreign to me, and was extremely enlightening. I'm not sure how far displaced I personally am from this culture, generationally speaking, but it's undoubtedly there. I'm glad somebody broke out earlier in my bloodline. 1 star off for the writing a memoir in your 30's, despite the author mentioning this very thing. I'd love to see how this not only plays out in his life, but what he actually does for others in his former circumstances, with this new-found perspective. Or gives more guidance on what the rest of us can do.</p>
