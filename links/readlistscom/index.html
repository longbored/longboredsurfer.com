<p>The folks at arc90/Readability have created something I really like (though I'm still <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/30/readability">leery of them</a>). Readlists give you the ability to create eBooks from a compilation of URLs. Simply type/paste in all the different pages you want combined, and it'll generate an eBook for you in multiple formats. It's perfect for things spread out over multiple pages (like <a href="http://www.tor.com/features/series/patrick-rothfuss-reread">Tor.com's Rothfuss Reread</a> (see my <a href="http://readlists.com/fed6f530">Name of the Wind</a> \&amp; <a href="http://readlists.com/b1bd508a/">The Wise Man's Fear</a> readlists)).I suppose that Marco Arment's brilliant <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> could do this same thing. You can just organize things in a folder, and export that individual folder as an ebook. The (current) benefit of Readlists is that they can be renamed, organized, and shared.</p>
