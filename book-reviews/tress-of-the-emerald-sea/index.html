<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
<p>This was really enjoyable. In the middle of the book, I texted my brother to say "I kind of forget that I need to slow down on [Brandon Sanderson's] books - I enjoy them so much that I want to keep reading/listening, but then I'm sad when they're done." Such was the case here. Narrated by a whimsical character, set in a brand new world (with a fun magic system), telling a story likely appealing to many readers, this was a really fun read. For those unfamiliar with Brandon Sanderson's broader set of work, I feel like this book would stand well enough on its own, without needing to have read anything else by him to enjoy this book.  </p>
<p>Lastly, if you listen to the book, make sure you at least flip through the physical or ebook, so you can see the variety of illustrations. They're done really well.</p>
