	<p>I don't mind Christmas Parties, really I don't. There are a variety of organizations that have Christmas parties. The group could be family, friends, work, or religious. In general, I don't have any beef with any of the parties that are listed. My expectations from a party are as follows (not listed in any specific order): friends, food and fun. Depending on the circumstances of the Christmas party, it could be appropriate to be reminded of the real reason/purpose of Christmas. What would be INappropriate would be most anything lame. Let me talk about my most recent party experience, which happened to be a church/religious function.</p>
<p>The event wasn't to be anything super special. We were told it would be lots of really good food, since apparently they had a gigantic budget. In addition to the food, there was to be a little program of some fashion. Personally, I'm not really in favor of such activities, but feeling cheap, and spotting a good opportunity for a free, and potentially tasty meal, we decided to go. Come to find out, there was indeed a lot of food, and it was pretty decent. There was also a little program, and a get-to-know-you activity to be done with the people at your table.</p>
<p>The activity was working perfectly. You were supposed to sit next to other people (duh), and ask them some questions. There was a paper there with the questions you were supposed to ask them. It had name, dream gift for Christmas, nickname, high school, stuff like that. Well, many of the questions were spurring additional conversation. After the two of you had finished doing your thing, you were supposed to pass the information on to the rest of the people at the table. Our conversation was working great. Somehow we got onto the topic of a battle/fight or competition between high school mascots. Despite the presence of 3 various canines, the <a href="http://www.lasd.k12.pa.us/Littlestown.html">thunder bolts</a> were bound to win against them all. We heard stories about sledding down ski slopes at night, while avoiding the snow cats, and going under bridges you could hardly see. All 4 couples/families at the table were getting along really well. The dumb part really came when they wanted to start their program.</p>
<p>The social events planned by my church tend to have that major problem. The point of the event is to socialize, but the downfall is to forget that key purpose. They'll create some additional activity/program/show that is supposed to be a form of entertainment, when really the attendees are entertained enough by each other. Then it becomes some sort of felony that we're enjoying each other, and not focusing on the planned program. The program for this even was the worst of all.</p>
<p>Let me establish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have a problem with Christmas sweaters and turtlenecks. (I personally don't choose to wear turtlenecks, and any sweater I own generally MUST be cotton, since I do very well at maintaining my body temperature)</li>
<li>I don't have a problem with singing Christmas carols.</li>
<li>I don't have a problem with hearing/reading Christmas stories</li>
</ul>
<p>I DO have a problem with a guy wearing the cheesiest and ugliest Christmas sweater with a turtleneck that who does karaoke to common Christmas Songs (and more than once forgot the words and did that whole "nah-nah-nah" thing), in between his wife reading stories that are boring and take too long. I kid you not, this was what happened. He reminded me of some <a href="http://www.iloverichardcheese.com/">lame lounge singer</a> who was even bad at doing that. He would do a couple songs, then his wife would come up and read a story. The first one was short, so it wasn't that bad. The second story she read was long enough that people were leaving in the middle of it. She wasn't a very good story teller either.</p>
<p>The people at our table weren't listening to the stuff going on, and we were trying to enjoy ourselves. At some point some old guy at another table told us to "shhh" and gave us one of those "you immature young-uns don't know what good music is" type of looks. It made me want to pay attention even less, if that were possible.</p>
<p>I was pleased when it all ended and I could go home. Good job to them on ending a good event in a poor performance. On a couple unrelated, yet related notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the couples at our table left the event early to go to another Christmas party. The one they were going to was a mock party, where everybody was supposed to wear cheesy/lame Christmas sweaters with turtlenecks, and tell dumb stories while sipping egg nog. How ironic that he was leaving one party where it was happening in seriousness and going to another where it was about to happen in jest.</p>
<p>I went to a family Christmas party more recently than the church one, and it wasn't that bad. Traditions are traditions, so I don't have any bashing there, but I'll limit my words to saying that one of the performers almost made the whole lot of us laugh, when it was a fully serious performance. It sucked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all though, I hope everybody out there has a very Merry Christmas, even if you're a schmoe who does everything I just made fun of.</p>
