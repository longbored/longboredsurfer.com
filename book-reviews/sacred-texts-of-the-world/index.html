<p>This was really interesting, and yet there is SO MUCH material to cover. And this isn't a deep dive on them by any stretch. You can read (or listen to) a section on a text you're familiar with, and see how you feel he did, and I'm guessing he did similarly for others. Dr. Grant goes through so many texts representing such a variety of religions. I was glad to have some clue of them, but admittedly by the end, I was struggling to keep all of them straight. After the fact, I feel like I need a summary guidebook that I can reference. As it is, I took notes out of the final section on some highlighted reading or ways to potentially experience smaller aspects of these texts. His focus wasn't on the religions themselves, but on the texts - so if you're looking for a comparative religion book, this probably isn't the one.</p>
