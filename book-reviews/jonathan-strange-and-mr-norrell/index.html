<div class="content"><p>How to summarize this book? It's written historically, acting as if magic were a matter of fact, and through the numerous (and extensive) cross-references, you were looking to get a better understand of magic's return to England, by way of Mr. Norrell (of course), and his apprentice-turned-semi-adversary Jonathan Strange.</p>
<p>It starts slow, and some of the details seem irrelevant. Admittedly, however, the world and vision of it all are rather rewarding in hindsight. Clearly Susanna Clarke has a gift for writing stories, and has done a wonderful job here. Despite how slow it _feels_ like it starts, so much happens in the last quarter of the book that immediately after finishing it, I immediately went back to re-read it from that point onward.</p>
<p>Between the two characters in the title, I also enjoyed the gentleman with the thistledown hair, and especially Stephen Black.</p></div>
