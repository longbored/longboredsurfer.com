<p>It doesn't feel fair to compare to Ready Player One, but it's inevitable. It's nowhere near as good. It's a cool premise, but with poorly veiled foreshadowing, too many coincidences to allow me to be invested in the events, and quite a bit of vulgar language. It probably doesn't help that I'm not as much of a fan of the 80's as the author. Still, like I already said, it's a fun premise, and has some charming elements.</p>
