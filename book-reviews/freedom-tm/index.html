<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>Daniel Suarez</b></p>
<p>The inevitable follow-up to Daniel Suarez's Daemon. The action picks right up where Daemon left off. Honestly, I don't know how you could read Daemon, like it, and _not_ read this book. The conflict between the democracy and meritocracy increases. Although this book is a bit more preachy than the previous, the action is still just as enjoyable. There are enough twists and turns (in what originally felt like would be a highly predictable book), to keep you second guessing, and engaged. Despite this, some of the themes get overplayed, and ultimately I wonder if I'd read a third book in the series.</p>
