<p>Another late one, but I really enjoyed this record album artwork. There's something... I don't know... uh... random, or unique, or I don't know. I can't really put my finger on it. I just really like the contrast between the current design styles and the older design of this era. Don't forget to check out <a href="http://www.dabbled.org/2009/05/defend-yourself-against-70s-kids-music.html">the article about them</a>.</p>
