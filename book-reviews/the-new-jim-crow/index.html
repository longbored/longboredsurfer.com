<div class="content"><p>The conclusions of the book are sobering, and make me feel like I need to be lots more involved and caring than I have been. Michelle Alexander, the author, put so much research and supporting statistics into this book, I find it hard for anybody to be able to arrive at a different conclusion than what she has.</p>
<p>As a white male, I wasn't looking forward to reading this book. It didn't take me long to be glad I had started it (and finished it), and disappointed I had waited so long. In the 10-year anniversary edition of the book, Alexander has added an updated prologue, which is a great addition. My only criticism of the book is that some of the individual points felt like they were stretched out to fill more space (a chapter?), when they had already been well-established.</p></div>
