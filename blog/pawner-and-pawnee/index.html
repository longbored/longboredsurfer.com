<p>Although you can take something to a pawn shop and they'll buy that item for a less-than-fair price, that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm referring to the times when you pawn something off onto somebody else. In this case you're essentially suckering them into taking something that is potentially less-than-desirable. Following this logic, you're the pawner and they're the pawnee. Doesn't that speak poorly for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawnee">Pawnee</a>? Despite my attempts to discover the root of their name as a tribe, I was unsuccessful. If people pawned off anything decent onto them, maybe they could now sell their stuff on eBay and make a buck or two... whatever.</p>
