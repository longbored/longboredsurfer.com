<p>Can 3.5 stars be a thing? This somewhat reminded me of "The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making", except far more reasonable, and 100% less "Oh, now they're just making stuff up to make stuff up"... if that's even a thing to consider when reading YA fantasy. I really liked the creative writing - the chapter names, that a bog could help raise a child, that a dragon can have a complex, the magic of the stars and moon and a pair of boots, and so much more. That said, it felt like I somehow got cheated by having it all capped. I wanted more focus on Luna (and her magic), and less on Antain.</p>
