	<p>Let me be pacific. I'm going to get out a grass skirt, coconut top, and let me ge lei-ed. Every time somebody says "pacific" when they most likely intend to say "specific" I automatically visualize that person in that attire. They're sitting back, sipping drinks, watching the ocean, and getting ready for the luau in the evening.</p>
<p>Let me be pacific. I'm going to get out a grass skirt, coconut top, and let me ge lei-ed. Every time somebody says "pacific" when they most likely intend to say "specific" I automatically visualize that person in that attire. They're sitting back, sipping drinks, watching the ocean, and getting ready for the luau in the evening.</p>
<p>They would probably not be following the company's dress code if they were wearing that. Some of the people who choose to say that are less than aesthetically pleasing when it comes to wearing nothing but coconuts in the northern hemisphere, not to mention the fact that the grass skirt can't cover up the cottage cheese that already stared me down.</p>
<p>What is so wrong with somebody being able to pronounce one little letter? It really does change the word entirely. Sure, if you want to get into the details, I choose to pronounce the two words differently (besides the obvious 'S' at the beginning of one). One of them I pronounce "puh-sih-fic" and the other I pronounce "speh-sih-fic". The real purpose here is to work on pronouncing the 'S' at the beginning.</p>
<h2>Words that mean something different if you take away the letter 'S'</h2>
<ul>
<li>tupid</li>
<li>hits</li>
<li>till</li>
<li>kip</li>
<li>imple</li>
<li>ounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Really seems to make a difference, doesn't it? Let's work on this one people. I'm not talking to all of you, just you pacific people specifically.</p>
