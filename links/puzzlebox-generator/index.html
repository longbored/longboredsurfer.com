<p>Late last year I got into 3D printing. For Christmas for my kids, I made a few of these, and then hid gifts inside. It was fantastic. I didn't want to post it on here, since who knows how tech-savvy kids are these days, and I didn't want to spoil the surprise. I've printed a variety of these, in different sizes, complexity, and with different options. They're great.</p>
