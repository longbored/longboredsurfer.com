<div class="content"><p>This was fine. Although I've already read a fair bit about this war, the narrative style of this book seems to have brought a few new details to my attention. That said, I don't think those details were very relevant. It was interesting to me to see how many times they revisited the discussion of why the South was fighting. Some falsely claim it was about "states rights" but I'm glad the historians continue to reiterate the truth of it: slavery, the horrendous "peculiar institution" which continues to echo in our modern history.  </p>
<p>Regardless, if you're into books about the Civil War, then I'd recommend this. If you're not, but still want some kind of narrative grasp on a notable battle, then I'd also recommend it. If neither of those things are true about you - whatever.</p></div>
