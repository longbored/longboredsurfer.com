	<p>I'm salaried. It sucks, since I can't get any overtime. I supposedly get paid more than I would if I weren't salaried. A good number of my coworkers are salaried as well. I don't mind if people choose to work over 40 hours. That's no big deal. I don't mind that some choose to work excessively.</p>
<p>Every week I have to fill out my time on a time sheet. All they ask me for is the number of hours that I have worked each day. I was told when I first came here, that it didn't matter what I put on there, since I would only be paid for 40 hours. The person who inputs the time says that she only puts down 8's for each day of the week. I'm not opposed to working more than 8 hours in a day, nor 40 hours in a week. But, if she's only going to input 8's into the system, then why bother putting anything else down on the sheet?</p>
<p>I have spoken before about a certain butt-kissing, brown-nosing individual who acts like he knows what he's talking about, when in reality his breath stinks horribly due to the fact that he's full of crap. Yes, his eyes are brown too.</p>
<p>I happened to notice that on the most recent time sheet, 'ol brainiac filled in having worked 16, 11, 12, 8, and 10 hours of work for the days of the week, totaling some 57 hours. My weakening math skills still tell me that 4 of those numbers do not equal 8.</p>
<p>Seriously dude, what are you hoping to accomplish by putting in those kind of hours each day? I hate to break it to you, but you're not that important, no matter how you try to twist it. If you're too dumb to figure out that no matter what you put down on the form she's only going to input 8's for you... then feel free to waste away your week working for those kind of hours. You probably need it. It's not like you're earning brownie points for it, since your boss never sees your time sheets.</p>
<p>Allow me to formally tell you that you're an idiot and you're wasting your time trying to remember how many hours you wasted at work, not to mention having to add up the hours to come up with something besides 40.</p>
<h2>You probably do some of the following things as well:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put in more than 25 cents into a gumball machine</li>
<li>Stop before a light turns yellow/red</li>
<li>Print off more copies than people in the building</li>
<li>Adjust the holes on the <a href="/blog/three-hole-punch">Three Hole Punch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite your best attempts to get on the good side of everybody, let me tell you that you're failing, at least when it comes to me. Also, I have it on good authority (your employees) that you suck as a leader. Please learn to fill out a time sheet like a normal person. It will be one step in the right direction.</p>
