	<p>Some birthday presents suck. For the most part there are two types of people who give these type of gifts - the bad gift giver &amp; the good gift-giver who is taking a trip down good intentions lane (but stumbles down bad delivery lane). Let's investigate this one a bit.</p>
<p>The bad gift giver doesn't know any better. For the most part they mean well, but they give you things at which you just shake your head. The worst gifts probably come from people who regularly are good gift givers. Before I continue, let me say that my most recent birthday was perfectly fine. There weren't any of these type of gifts to which I am referring.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this since it has been roughly a year since I was given one of these infamous gifts. I've stated several times before that I acknowledge I am overweight. I'm not slim, I'm heavy, I've got what the doctors call a little bit of a weight problem. But if somebody in my case doesn't ask for a scale for their birthday, it would probably be best not to give it to them.</p>
<p>Sure, I didn't have a scale. Yes, to help avoid any weight and the gaining thereof, a scale would be nice. The speed bump is that it was not on my birthday list and could easily lead to further angering situations. Thankfully I have spent time with a certain culture where fatness and the pointing-out thereof is an everyday/conversation/sentence type of thing.</p>
<p>To wrap this up, some gifts shouldn't be given unless specifically requested, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>Nose hair trimmer</li>
<li>Underwear</li>
<li>Maternity clothes to somebody who isn't expecting</li>
<li>Mouth Wash</li>
<li>Deodorant</li>
<li>(most personal care products)</li>
<li>Contraceptives</li>
</ul>
