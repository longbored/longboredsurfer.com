	<p>I'm not exactly an expert on music. I listen to it, and really enjoy it. I happen to be listening to the Queen album "A Night At the Opera". To sum up the rest of this post, it's a great album.</p>
<p>From what I've been able to gather, this 4th album was the launching platform for them into true popularity. It's a rich album, with talent spread across the instruments, vocals, and collaboration. Their most popular song, "Bohemian Rhapsody", is on this album, and is a great example of their musical abilities.</p>
<p>I'm not going to act like I know much about Queen, but from what I've heard previously, or read with regards to their biography, they were one of rock's best. There's something to be said for eccentricity. Congrats on the 30th anniversary release of such a spectacular album.</p>
<p>People probably don't think about the lasting effects of their music when they write it. They probably don't sit down and say "Okay here... let's write a song that's going to be popular for the next 30 years." Sure, if you want to talk about songs that have beat out Bohemian Rhapsody, that's fine. I just think that writing good music has got to be a little intimidating. Queen may not be The Beatles, or Elvis, or Mozart, but a good job on some well done music.</p>
