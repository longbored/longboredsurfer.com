<p class="meta">Published on 2009-12-15 by <b>Pedro</b></p>
<p>I've watched too many infomercials about the Cricut - a personal CNC machine for crafters. I think it'd be slick to own one, but I've never been able to convince myself that it'd be worth it, mainly because it seemed that you'd be stuck buying their cartridges as $50 a piece. Luckily, it appears this company has built a computer program that lets you use any typeface or other vector on your computer and print it while attaching your Cricut to a computer. It's still a $180 machine (for the smallest), and another $75 for this program.</p>
